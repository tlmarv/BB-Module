  "question": "A 32-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to abrupt changes in behavior. He reports that she sometimes speaks with a different accent and does not recognize her children. These episodes last for hours and then she returns to her baseline without memory of the events. She has a history of childhood abuse and multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Schizophrenia",
    "Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features",
    "Dissociative identity disorder",
    "Depersonalization/derealization disorder",
    "Frontal lobe epilepsy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Dissociative identity disorder (DID). DID is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or identities that may control the individual's behavior at different times, often accompanied by memory gaps for everyday events, personal information, or traumatic events. The patient's identity switching and amnesia, especially in the context of severe trauma history, are hallmark features. Schizophrenia involves persistent delusions or hallucinations, not identity alteration. Bipolar I may involve mood changes but not identity fragmentation. Depersonalization/derealization involves detachment without identity loss. Frontal lobe epilepsy could cause transient behavioral changes but not multiple identity phenomena."

  "question": "A 28-year-old man is evaluated after a traumatic motor vehicle accident in which his best friend died. He reports persistent nightmares, avoids driving, and has begun drinking heavily. One month after the incident, he has difficulty sleeping, feels numb, and is hypervigilant. Which of the following features most clearly distinguishes post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from acute stress disorder (ASD)?",
  "choices": [
    "Presence of dissociative amnesia",
    "Re-experiencing symptoms",
    "Symptoms lasting more than one month",
    "Avoidance behaviors",
    "Exposure to a traumatic stressor"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Symptoms lasting more than one month. Both PTSD and ASD require exposure to trauma and can include similar symptoms such as re-experiencing, avoidance, and dissociation. The key diagnostic difference is duration: ASD is diagnosed when symptoms last between 3 days and 1 month post-trauma; PTSD requires symptoms persisting for at least one month. Dissociative amnesia and re-experiencing can occur in both disorders. Avoidance is a criterion for both, and trauma exposure is required for either diagnosis."

  "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with persistent feelings that her surroundings feel dreamlike and that she is watching herself from outside her body. These episodes began shortly after surviving a domestic violence incident. She describes her body as 'numb' and her memories as 'hollow,' lacking emotional content. Which of the following best explains the neuropsychological mechanism underlying her symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis",
    "Increased amygdala activity during threat perception",
    "Maladaptive encoding of traumatic memory by the hippocampus",
    "Disruption of integration between perceptual processing and self-awareness",
    "Volitional detachment from emotionally charged memories"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Disruption of integration between perceptual processing and self-awareness. Depersonalization and derealization symptoms reflect a disruption in the brain’s ability to integrate multisensory input and internal self-monitoring, leading to detachment from the body or environment. This often follows trauma as a coping mechanism. HPA axis and amygdala activity play roles in stress and fear responses but do not fully explain dissociative perceptual detachment. Hippocampal dysfunction contributes to memory fragmentation but not directly to perceptual distortions. Volitional detachment implies conscious effort, which is not the case in these dissociative symptoms."

  "question": "A 35-year-old man with schizophrenia has persistent positive symptoms despite treatment with risperidone. A recent neuroimaging study shows decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and increased dopaminergic signaling in the mesolimbic pathway. Based on current neurochemical hypotheses, which of the following best explains the persistence of his symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Hyperdopaminergic activity in the mesocortical pathway",
    "Hypodopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway",
    "Hyperdopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway",
    "Hypoglutamatergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway",
    "Excessive serotonin activity in the dorsal raphe nuclei"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Hyperdopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway. Positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) are linked to increased dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway. In contrast, negative and cognitive symptoms correlate with reduced dopamine activity in the mesocortical pathway. The nigrostriatal pathway is associated with motor control, and tuberoinfundibular dopamine inhibits prolactin. Serotonin from the dorsal raphe modulates mood, not psychosis directly."

{
  "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with fatigue, hypersomnia, weight gain, and persistent feelings of worthlessness for the past month. She is diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Which of the following mechanisms best explains how mirtazapine alleviates her symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Inhibition of monoamine oxidase leading to increased serotonin levels",
    "Blockade of serotonin reuptake transporters on presynaptic neurons",
    "Direct agonism of dopamine D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex",
    "Blockade of alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors increasing monoamine release",
    "Antagonism of GABA-A receptors leading to enhanced arousal"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Blockade of alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors increasing monoamine release. Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant that increases the release of serotonin and norepinephrine by blocking inhibitory alpha-2 autoreceptors. This differs from SSRIs, which inhibit serotonin reuptake, and MAOIs, which prevent neurotransmitter breakdown. D2 receptor agonism is associated with antipsychotics and not used in depression. GABA-A antagonism would promote excitability and is not a mechanism of mirtazapine."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man with HIV presents with memory loss, apathy, and motor slowing. His physician suspects a neurodegenerative process involving the kynurenine pathway. Excess quinolinic acid is believed to be contributing to NMDA receptor overactivation. Which neurotransmitter system is most likely implicated in the pathogenesis of his symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Dopamine hypofunction in the mesolimbic pathway",
    "GABA deficiency in the basal ganglia",
    "Glutamate excitotoxicity in the prefrontal cortex",
    "Serotonin excess in the dorsal raphe nucleus",
    "Acetylcholine depletion in the septal nuclei"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Glutamate excitotoxicity in the prefrontal cortex. The kynurenine pathway, particularly through the production of quinolinic acid, leads to overstimulation of NMDA receptors, a subtype of glutamate receptor. This process contributes to neuronal damage and is implicated in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and depression. Dopamine hypofunction and GABA deficiency are associated with different symptoms. Serotonin and acetylcholine dysregulation have roles in mood and memory but do not explain the excitotoxic mechanism described here."

  "question": "A 10-year-old boy is referred for persistent defiant behavior. He argues with teachers, deliberately annoys classmates, and blames others for his own mistakes. Despite having no history of aggression, property destruction, or serious rule violations, his behavior has caused significant disruptions at home and school for over 8 months. He has a past diagnosis of ADHD, which improved with methylphenidate. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
  "choices": [
    "Initiate risperidone for behavioral control",
    "Refer for parent management training and behavioral therapy",
    "Add a mood stabilizer to address defiance",
    "Discontinue ADHD medication to rule out side effects",
    "Diagnose conduct disorder and initiate legal involvement"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Refer for parent management training and behavioral therapy. The patient meets diagnostic criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), which is characterized by angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness without the more severe features of conduct disorder (e.g., aggression, property destruction). Parent management training is first-line treatment and has strong evidence for improving behavioral outcomes. Risperidone and mood stabilizers may be used if aggression persists or comorbidities warrant, but behavioral interventions are preferred initially. ADHD medication is not contraindicated and has already shown benefit. Legal action is inappropriate for ODD."

  "question": "A 15-year-old boy is referred to a juvenile court clinic after multiple arrests, including burglary, assault, and school truancy. He started skipping school before age 13 and once ran away overnight. His parents report a history of cruelty to animals and lying for personal gain. He does not show remorse. Which of the following factors most strongly predicts a poor long-term prognosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Lack of remorse",
    "Exposure to community violence",
    "Early onset of symptoms before age 10",
    "Male gender",
    "Low socioeconomic status"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Early onset of symptoms before age 10. Conduct disorder with childhood-onset type is associated with a worse prognosis, including a higher risk for persistent antisocial behavior, adult criminality, and development of antisocial personality disorder. Although all the other listed factors contribute to risk, the age of onset is the strongest single predictor of long-term outcome. Lack of remorse is a specifier for 'limited prosocial emotions' but does not independently predict prognosis as robustly as early onset."

  "question": "A 13-year-old girl is brought in for uncontrollable episodes of shoplifting. She reports feeling intense tension before the act and a sense of relief afterward. The stolen items are not needed or used. She expresses shame and confusion, stating she cannot resist the urge. She has a history of bulimia nervosa and depression. What is the most likely neurobiological mechanism underlying her condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Reduced dopaminergic tone in the nucleus accumbens",
    "Hyperactivity of the prefrontal cortex leading to compulsivity",
    "Frontal lobe disinhibition and impaired impulse regulation",
    "Hypoactivation of the amygdala during risk-taking behavior",
    "Serotonergic excess in the orbitofrontal cortex"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Frontal lobe disinhibition and impaired impulse regulation. Kleptomania is associated with impaired executive functioning and frontal lobe dysregulation, particularly in circuits that govern inhibition and impulse control. Neuroimaging studies suggest abnormalities in white matter tracts and impaired frontostriatal connectivity. Dopaminergic or serotonergic theories apply more to addiction and mood disorders. Amygdala hypoactivation is linked to risk-blindness, but not specific to impulse-control disorders like kleptomania."

  "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his parents due to concerns about his school performance. His teacher reports he frequently forgets to turn in homework, loses his supplies, and often appears distracted in class. Despite having average intelligence, he struggles to follow multi-step instructions. He becomes easily frustrated when working on tasks that require sustained mental effort. His developmental milestones were normal. Which neurotransmitter system dysfunction most likely contributes to his core symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "GABAergic hypoactivity in the amygdala",
    "Dopamine and norepinephrine hypoactivity in the fronto-striatal circuits",
    "Increased serotonin turnover in the hippocampus",
    "Acetylcholine hyperactivity in the reticular activating system",
    "Elevated glutamate transmission in the cerebellum"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Dopamine and norepinephrine hypoactivity in the fronto-striatal circuits. ADHD is associated with reduced dopaminergic and noradrenergic tone in circuits connecting the frontal cortex and subcortical areas such as the striatum and limbic system. This contributes to deficits in attention regulation, working memory, and executive function. GABAergic dysfunction is more related to anxiety. Serotonin and glutamate dysregulation are implicated in mood and neurodegenerative disorders, respectively. Acetylcholine has a role in arousal but is not a central mechanism in ADHD pathogenesis."

  "question": "A 25-year-old man with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD presents for follow-up. He reports persistent distractibility, difficulty completing work tasks, and frequent speeding tickets. He denies hallucinations or mood swings. Physical exam and labs are unremarkable. He is currently on methylphenidate. Which of the following side effects is most important to monitor during continued treatment?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased risk of hypertensive crisis",
    "Onset of manic symptoms in bipolar disorder",
    "Sedation and weight gain",
    "Urinary retention and dry mouth",
    "Hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Onset of manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. Stimulants such as methylphenidate can precipitate manic episodes in individuals with undiagnosed or poorly managed bipolar disorder. This makes it essential to screen for mood instability prior to initiating or continuing stimulant therapy. Hypertensive crisis is a concern with MAOIs, not methylphenidate. Sedation is more typical of non-stimulant agents like clonidine. Anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth are not prominent with stimulants. Hyperprolactinemia is associated with antipsychotics, not ADHD medications."

{
  "question": "A 12-year-old girl is diagnosed with combined-type ADHD. Her parents prefer a non-stimulant medication due to a family history of substance use disorder. She is started on atomoxetine. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of this medication?",
  "choices": [
    "Dopamine D2 receptor partial agonist",
    "Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibition",
    "GABA-A receptor agonism",
    "NMDA receptor antagonism",
    "Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockade"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant approved for ADHD that works by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, thereby increasing its availability in the prefrontal cortex. This enhances attention and reduces impulsivity. D2 receptor modulation is the mechanism of antipsychotics. GABA-A receptor agonism is typical of benzodiazepines. NMDA antagonism is a mechanism for certain anesthetics and agents like memantine. Alpha-1 blockade is associated with hypotension and is not central to atomoxetine’s effect."
},
{
  "question": "A 10-year-old boy is diagnosed with ADHD and started on methylphenidate. After several weeks, he develops insomnia and reduced appetite. His physician considers switching to a different stimulant. Compared to methylphenidate, which of the following best describes a mechanistic distinction of amphetamine that may underlie both therapeutic effects and side effects?",
  "choices": [
    "Selective inhibition of serotonin transporter",
    "Direct agonism at dopamine D2 receptors",
    "Increased dopamine vesicular release via VMAT inhibition",
    "Selective inhibition of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors",
    "Enhanced dopamine metabolism by monoamine oxidase"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Increased dopamine vesicular release via VMAT inhibition. Amphetamines not only block the dopamine transporter (DAT), but also impair vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) function, leading to increased cytoplasmic dopamine and reverse transport of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. This results in higher synaptic dopamine levels than with methylphenidate, which primarily inhibits DAT. Serotonin transporter inhibition is characteristic of SSRIs and MDMA. D2 receptor agonism is unrelated to stimulant action. Alpha-2 receptor blockade would increase sympathetic tone, but amphetamines do not act via this mechanism. Enhancing dopamine metabolism would reduce dopaminergic activity, opposite to the effect of amphetamines."

{
  "question": "A 27-year-old woman with a history of ADHD reports using intranasal cocaine recreationally. She describes intense euphoria, elevated confidence, and increased motor activity. Which of the following best explains the heightened addictive potential of intranasal versus oral administration of stimulants?",
  "choices": [
    "Lower plasma protein binding increases drug availability",
    "Slower first-pass metabolism allows for prolonged duration",
    "Higher bioavailability due to absence of hepatic degradation",
    "More rapid delivery to the brain enhances dopaminergic surge",
    "Increased interaction with alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the brain"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: More rapid delivery to the brain enhances dopaminergic surge. The route of administration strongly influences the addictive potential of stimulants. Intranasal or intravenous administration allows for rapid crossing of the blood-brain barrier, resulting in a sharp increase in synaptic dopamine within the nucleus accumbens—key to reinforcing drug-seeking behavior. Oral administration leads to slower CNS penetration, reducing euphoric effects. While hepatic metabolism and receptor binding affect drug duration and potency, the speed of dopamine elevation in mesolimbic structures is the primary factor behind addictive potential."
},
{
  "question": "A 7-year-old boy with ADHD is being treated with guanfacine. His parents are concerned about drowsiness and reduced alertness during school. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the therapeutic benefit of guanfacine in ADHD despite its sedative profile?",
  "choices": [
    "Activation of alpha-2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex enhances executive function",
    "Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to increased arousal",
    "Blocking of alpha-1 receptors improves blood flow to the cortex",
    "Stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area increases reward sensitivity",
    "Blockade of serotonin receptors reduces impulsivity"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Activation of alpha-2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex enhances executive function. Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist. It enhances signal transmission in the prefrontal cortex by reducing tonic noradrenergic noise, which improves attention and working memory in patients with ADHD. Despite its sedative properties, this targeted action supports cognitive control. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition describes atomoxetine. Alpha-1 blockade does not enhance prefrontal function. Dopamine activation is more associated with stimulants. Serotonin receptor blockade is not the mechanism for guanfacine’s effect."

  "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with obsessive thoughts about being contaminated and performs hand-washing rituals for several hours each day. She is aware these thoughts are irrational but cannot suppress the urge. She is started on high-dose fluoxetine. After 12 weeks, she shows partial improvement. The psychiatrist decides to augment pharmacotherapy. Which of the following is the most appropriate agent to add in this case?",
  "choices": [
    "Clonazepam",
    "Quetiapine",
    "Risperidone",
    "Haloperidol",
    "Lithium"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Risperidone. In patients with OCD who do not fully respond to SSRIs, augmentation with low-dose atypical antipsychotics like risperidone has shown benefit, especially when there are comorbid tics or treatment-resistant symptoms. Clonazepam is not a first-line augmentation strategy due to tolerance and dependency risks. Quetiapine is sometimes used off-label but with less evidence than risperidone. Haloperidol is less preferred due to extrapyramidal side effects. Lithium is used for mood stabilization but not for OCD augmentation."

  "question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with a long-standing pattern of perfectionism and rigidity. She insists on organizing every aspect of her environment and often redoes her roommate’s chores to meet her standards. She denies distress and believes her behaviors are beneficial. She has no intrusive thoughts or rituals. Which feature best distinguishes her condition from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?",
  "choices": [
    "Presence of comorbid anxiety",
    "Repetitive behaviors such as counting or checking",
    "Ego-dystonic nature of intrusive thoughts",
    "History of childhood tics",
    "Female predominance"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Ego-dystonic nature of intrusive thoughts. OCD is characterized by ego-dystonic thoughts—intrusive and distressing ideas that are inconsistent with the patient's self-image. In contrast, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) involves ego-syntonic traits, meaning the behaviors align with the individual's values and self-perception. This woman’s behaviors reflect personality structure rather than distress-driven compulsions. Comorbid anxiety and gender are nonspecific. Childhood tics are more associated with OCD."

  "question": "A 14-year-old boy presents with repeated hair-pulling resulting in noticeable bald patches. He reports that pulling relieves internal tension. His physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following diagnostic assessments is most important to consider in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Serum ferritin and iron panel",
    "EEG to rule out focal seizures",
    "Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)",
    "Abdominal imaging for trichobezoar",
    "Genetic testing for Prader-Willi syndrome"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Abdominal imaging for trichobezoar. Trichotillomania can lead to trichophagia (swallowing hair), which may result in the formation of a trichobezoar—a mass of hair in the gastrointestinal tract that can cause obstruction and require surgical intervention. Although iron deficiency may co-exist, it’s not diagnostic. EEG and genetic testing are unnecessary unless other features are present. Y-BOCS is used in OCD but not specifically for trichotillomania."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with symptoms of low mood, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and feelings of heaviness in her limbs for the past 3 weeks. She also reports temporary mood improvement when her friends visit or when she watches her favorite shows. She has a history of poor response to SSRIs in the past and is currently not on any medication. Which of the following treatment options would be most appropriate to consider next?",
    "choices": [
      "Start bupropion",
      "Add lithium",
      "Begin monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy",
      "Start SNRI like venlafaxine",
      "Refer for electroconvulsive therapy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with major depressive disorder with atypical features, characterized by mood reactivity, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis, and sensitivity to interpersonal rejection. While SSRIs are typically first-line, MAOIs have been shown to be especially efficacious for atypical depression and are often considered after SSRIs fail. Bupropion is not ideal here due to its activating profile (opposite of what’s needed for hypersomnia), and lithium is more for augmentation or mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. SNRIs are not specifically more effective than SSRIs for atypical features, and ECT is generally reserved for severe or treatment-resistant cases, often with psychotic features or suicidality."

She denies hallucinations or delusions. She reports that a similar episode occurred after the birth of her first child. What is the most likely neurobiological factor contributing to her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Elevated dopamine synthesis in the prefrontal cortex",
      "Increased cortisol from HPA axis overactivation",
      "Acute withdrawal of allopregnanolone post-delivery",
      "Serotonin receptor downregulation due to prior SSRI use",
      "Low norepinephrine turnover in the locus coeruleus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The most likely explanation is an acute withdrawal of allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid and metabolite of progesterone that modulates GABA-A receptors. Levels of allopregnanolone are high during pregnancy and drop rapidly postpartum, which is thought to contribute to peripartum depression. This distinguishes peripartum MDD from other types, especially given her prior history of similar symptoms. HPA axis dysfunction and low monoamines are general MDD pathophysiology, but not specific to peripartum onset."

He denies suicidal ideation but expresses profound anhedonia and impaired functioning. His current medication regimen includes sertraline 200 mg daily. What is the next best step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Discontinue sertraline and initiate tricyclic antidepressant therapy",
      "Add a second-generation antipsychotic for augmentation",
      "Refer for psychotherapy and discontinue pharmacologic therapy",
      "Begin a 14-day washout and start a monoamine oxidase inhibitor",
      "Add lithium and discontinue current antidepressant"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient meets the criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defined as failure of at least 2 adequate antidepressant trials. Augmentation with a second-generation antipsychotic (e.g., aripiprazole or quetiapine) is a common and evidence-supported next step in managing TRD. TCAs and MAOIs can be considered later, but they come with higher side effect burdens and safety concerns, particularly in older adults. Lithium can be effective as an augmenting agent but typically is not first-line unless there is evidence of suicidality or bipolar spectrum."

Two weeks later, she presents to the emergency department with agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, and clonus. She has been taking sertraline and recently began using over-the-counter dextromethorphan for a cough. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for her current condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leading to hypertensive crisis",
      "Dopamine receptor blockade causing extrapyramidal symptoms",
      "Serotonin excess due to additive serotonergic activity",
      "Muscarinic antagonism leading to anticholinergic delirium",
      "Histamine receptor antagonism leading to sedation and confusion"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Serotonin excess due to additive serotonergic activity. This patient is experiencing serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excess serotonergic activity in the CNS. The combination of an SSRI (sertraline) and dextromethorphan (which has serotonergic properties) can precipitate this. Symptoms include hyperthermia, clonus, hyperreflexia, agitation, and autonomic instability. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition may lead to hypertensive symptoms, but not clonus and hyperreflexia. Dopamine blockade causes EPS, while muscarinic and histaminergic effects explain other side effects but not the syndrome seen here."

One week later, he develops severe headache, nausea, and markedly elevated blood pressure after eating aged cheese at a party. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Reduced serotonin synthesis in the raphe nuclei",
      "Tyramine-induced catecholamine release with inhibited breakdown",
      "Enhanced glutamate transmission in limbic circuits",
      "Autoimmune adrenal hyperfunction leading to cortisol excess",
      "Acute dopamine depletion in the mesolimbic system"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Tyramine-induced catecholamine release with inhibited breakdown. MAOIs like phenelzine inhibit the breakdown of monoamines, including dietary tyramine. Tyramine normally is metabolized by MAO-A in the gut; when it accumulates, it displaces norepinephrine from vesicles, causing a hypertensive crisis. This is why patients are advised to avoid aged cheeses, wines, and certain meats. The syndrome is unrelated to serotonin synthesis, glutamate transmission, or autoimmune adrenal dysfunction. Dopamine depletion can cause parkinsonism but is not relevant here."

He reports increased energy and focus within a few days but returns later with insomnia and anxiety. He has a history of alcohol use disorder but has been sober for 6 months. Which of the following is the most likely adverse effect associated with this medication in the context of his history?",
    "choices": [
      "Seizure exacerbation due to dopaminergic stimulation",
      "Hypertensive crisis due to increased norepinephrine",
      "Anhedonia from serotonin receptor downregulation",
      "Hyperglycemia via HPA axis activation",
      "Bradycardia from muscarinic receptor blockade"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Seizure exacerbation due to dopaminergic stimulation. This patient is most likely taking bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). While bupropion is activating and can be helpful for low-energy depression, it lowers the seizure threshold, especially in individuals with a history of eating disorders, alcohol use disorder, or brain injury. The risk is not primarily due to norepinephrine. Hypertensive crisis is not common with bupropion. Serotonin modulation is minimal with this drug. It does not significantly affect glucose or muscarinic tone."

She has undergone extensive medical evaluations including CT scans, endoscopy, and blood work, all of which were normal. She frequently visits multiple physicians and is convinced she has a serious undiagnosed illness. She becomes anxious if tests are not ordered. Which of the following diagnostic criteria must be present to confirm a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder?",
    "choices": [
      "Symptoms must be unexplained by medical conditions",
      "Evidence of intentional symptom production must be present",
      "Symptoms must persist for more than 12 months",
      "Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms",
      "Symptoms must result in a formal diagnosis by a specialist"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms. According to DSM-5 criteria for somatic symptom disorder, the patient must have distressing somatic symptoms plus excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to those symptoms. Importantly, DSM-5 no longer requires symptoms to be medically unexplained. There is no requirement for 12-month duration (6 months suffices), nor must a specialist confirm diagnosis. Intentional production of symptoms would indicate factitious disorder or malingering, not somatic symptom disorder."

Which of the following factors is most strongly associated with this presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Excess dopamine synthesis in the nigrostriatal pathway",
      "Deficiency of orexin in the hypothalamus",
      "History of childhood trauma and psychiatric comorbidity",
      "Structural abnormalities of the hippocampus",
      "Underlying viral encephalitis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: History of childhood trauma and psychiatric comorbidity. This presentation is consistent with functional neurologic symptom disorder (conversion disorder), particularly psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). A strong association exists between PNES and childhood trauma, along with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity such as depression, anxiety, or personality disorders. There is no evidence supporting orexin, dopamine, or hippocampal pathology in PNES. Viral encephalitis would more likely present with altered mental status, fever, or focal neurological findings."

    "question": "A 36-year-old female nurse is admitted for the fourth time in 12 months for hypernatremia and dehydration. Extensive testing reveals no organic cause. During her hospitalizations, she is overly familiar with staff and frequently requests invasive testing. She has no external incentives for illness behavior. Which of the following features most clearly differentiates her condition from malingering?",
    "choices": [
      "History of healthcare employment",
      "Deliberate symptom falsification",
      "Desire for medical attention in the absence of external gain",
      "Inconsistent clinical findings",
      "Multiple prior hospitalizations"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Desire for medical attention in the absence of external gain. Factitious disorder is characterized by intentional production of symptoms for internal psychological reasons, such as the need to assume a sick role. This contrasts with malingering, where the motive is external (e.g., financial gain, avoiding work). While features like healthcare employment, multiple hospitalizations, and inconsistent findings may be seen in both, the absence of external incentives is what definitively distinguishes factitious disorder from malingering."

    "question": "A 40-year-old man recently diagnosed with HIV presents with depressed mood, poor sleep, and suicidal ideation. He expresses intense guilt and social isolation since learning of his diagnosis. He started antiretroviral therapy (ART) but inconsistently adheres to it. Which of the following best explains the bidirectional relationship between HIV and depression in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "HIV increases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens leading to emotional instability",
      "Depression increases CD8+ T cell activity which lowers viral load but increases symptoms",
      "HIV-related immune activation and CNS inflammation increase risk of depression, which then worsens ART adherence and health outcomes",
      "Psychological stress from HIV diagnosis lowers CD4 count through direct T cell depletion",
      "Depression reduces viral replication due to HPA axis suppression"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: HIV-related immune activation and CNS inflammation increase risk of depression, which then worsens ART adherence and health outcomes. Depression is highly prevalent in people living with HIV (PLWH), and its pathogenesis involves both psychological and biological mechanisms. HIV directly affects the CNS, contributing to inflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation, which can trigger or worsen depressive symptoms. Depression, in turn, negatively impacts ART adherence, retention in care, and viral suppression. There is no evidence that depression improves HIV outcomes or alters T cell responses beneficially."

    "question": "A 32-year-old transgender woman with a history of HIV, PTSD, and opioid use disorder is brought in for care after missing multiple appointments. She reports being harassed at her housing shelter and fears discrimination from healthcare providers. Her viral load is detectable despite being prescribed ART. Which of the following best explains the layered impact on her HIV care engagement?",
    "choices": [
      "PTSD is the strongest predictor of treatment nonadherence in all populations",
      "Stigma is solely driven by individual beliefs and not systemic factors",
      "Minority stress from overlapping identities and structural barriers contributes to poor health outcomes",
      "ART nonadherence is primarily related to opioid-induced cognitive deficits",
      "Access to ART is unaffected by housing status in developed countries"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Minority stress from overlapping identities and structural barriers contributes to poor health outcomes. Layered or intersectional minority stress recognizes how overlapping marginalized identities (e.g., transgender, HIV+, substance use history) amplify discrimination and vulnerability. These compounded barriers lead to poorer mental health, reduced access to care, and decreased ART adherence. Structural determinants such as unstable housing and stigma within healthcare systems significantly impact outcomes. PTSD, while relevant, is not the sole factor. Statements denying systemic factors or housing barriers are incorrect."

    "question": "A 50-year-old man with well-controlled HIV presents with fatigue, insomnia, and low mood. He reports difficulty maintaining medication adherence due to lack of motivation and poor concentration. He is worried about being judged if he tells others about his diagnosis. Which of the following interventions is most likely to improve both his depressive symptoms and ART adherence?",
    "choices": [
      "Switching to a protease inhibitor-based regimen",
      "Increasing ART pill burden to reinforce accountability",
      "Referral for cognitive behavioral therapy and mental health screening",
      "Immediate hospitalization to monitor ART administration",
      "Replacing ART with intermittent prophylactic antibiotics"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Referral for cognitive behavioral therapy and mental health screening. Integrated mental health services are essential for managing depression in PLWH, especially given its strong association with poor ART adherence. Psychotherapeutic interventions like CBT, in combination with antidepressants when needed, can address cognitive distortions, internalized stigma, and behavior patterns affecting adherence. Hospitalization is not indicated in the absence of acute suicidality or medical instability. Switching ART regimens or increasing pill burden without addressing underlying psychological issues will not improve outcomes."
