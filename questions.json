    "question": "A 2-year-old boy has 2 days of fever and ear-tugging. Otoscopy shows a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane with decreased mobility. This is his third episode this year. His parent asks why children get middle-ear infections more often and which nerve injury could make pressure equalization worse. Which combination is most accurate?",
    "choices": [
      "More horizontally oriented eustachian tubes in children; injury to CN V3 can impair active opening of the tube via tensor veli palatini",
      "Shorter, S-shaped external acoustic meatus in children; injury to CN X can impair stapedius reflex",
      "Thinner tympanic membrane in children; injury to CN IX can impair levator veli palatini",
      "Smaller mastoid antrum in children; injury to CN VII can impair tensor tympani",
      "Less cerumen production in children; injury to CN III can impair levator veli palatini"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: More horizontally oriented eustachian tubes in children; injury to CN V3 can impair active opening of the tube via tensor veli palatini. Pediatric eustachian tubes are shorter and more horizontal, which hinders drainage and pressure equalization, predisposing to acute otitis media. Tensor veli palatini (V3) actively helps open the pharyngotympanic tube; a V3 lesion can worsen dysfunction. The external acoustic meatus shape is not the key risk, and stapedius is CN VII, not X. Levator veli palatini is innervated by CN X, not IX. Tensor tympani is innervated by V3, not VII. CN III does not innervate palatal or eustachian tube muscles."

    "question": "A 34-year-old develops right facial weakness after an acute facial nerve palsy. Sounds on the right now seem painfully loud. Which structure’s dysfunction best explains this new auditory symptom?",
    "choices": [
      "Stapedius muscle innervated by CN VII, which normally dampens stapes movement at the oval window",
      "Tensor tympani muscle innervated by CN VII, which normally tenses the tympanic membrane",
      "Chorda tympani branch of CN VII, which normally carries taste fibers from the posterior third of the tongue",

      "Auriculotemporal nerve (V3), which provides most tactile sensation to the external acoustic meatus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Stapedius muscle innervated by CN VII, which normally dampens stapes movement at the oval window. Paralysis of stapedius prevents sound attenuation and produces hyperacusis. Tensor tympani is innervated by V3, not VII. Chorda tympani carries taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to salivary glands; it does not attenuate sound. Injury to the malleus typically causes conductive hearing loss, not hyperacusis. The auriculotemporal nerve provides cutaneous sensation to parts of the external ear but does not control ossicular sound attenuation."

    "choices": [
      "Slow deviation of both eyes to the right with no fast phase, indicating intact brainstem vestibulo-ocular reflex pathways",
      "Fast nystagmus to the right with slow drift to the left, indicating intact frontal eye fields only",
      "No slow deviation or fast phase, indicating intact cortex but a brainstem lesion only",

      "Sustained conjugate gaze deviation to the left from an isolated medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Slow deviation of both eyes to the right with no fast phase, indicating intact brainstem vestibulo-ocular reflex pathways. Cold caloric testing drives the slow phase toward the irrigated ear; in coma, the cortical fast corrective phase is absent, so only the slow deviation is seen if the brainstem is intact. Fast nystagmus to the side opposite the cold ear occurs in an awake person (COWS), not in coma. Absence of both slow and fast phases suggests brainstem vestibulo-ocular reflex failure or heavy sedation rather than intact cortex. Slow right then fast left (COWS) is the normal awake response. An isolated MLF lesion impairs conjugate gaze coordination but does not by itself explain the coma-specific caloric pattern described."

Which structure and orientation most directly detect the missing stimulus in a healthy person?",
    "choices": [

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Saccular macula oriented vertically on the anteromedial wall to detect vertical translation and forward/backward tilt. The saccule’s macula lies in the vertical plane and senses vertical motion (e.g., elevator changes) and fore–aft tilt, whereas the utricle’s macula is horizontal and senses side-to-side translation and tilt. Semicircular duct cristae detect angular (rotational) acceleration, not linear translation. The Organ of Corti mediates hearing. The endolymphatic sac functions as a reservoir and for resorption, not primary linear-motion sensing."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Malformation of the malleus and incus derived from first pharyngeal arch (Meckel’s) cartilage. Atresia of the external auditory canal results from failure of the meatal plug to degenerate and is commonly associated with microtia and variable middle-ear defects; the malleus and incus are first-arch derivatives and are frequently involved. Otosclerosis is a later-onset abnormal bony overgrowth near the stapes and is not a typical neonatal congenital association. The endolymphatic sac’s role is endolymph storage/resorption, not canal formation. The tympanic cavity derives from the first (not second) pharyngeal pouch, and the tympanic membrane normally has ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal layers. "

      "Round window membrane"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Endolymphatic sac (via the endolymphatic duct). The endolymphatic duct and sac act as a reservoir and site of endolymph resorption; impaired resorption causes endolymphatic hydrops, producing pressure/fullness, hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance symptoms. Utricular and saccular maculae are the linear-acceleration sensors, not the resorptive pathway. Perilymph spaces and the round window are not responsible for endolymph homeostasis."

CT suggests abnormal bone near the oval window. She elects to undergo stapedectomy. Which postoperative complaint would most specifically indicate iatrogenic injury to a structure at risk during this middle-ear surgery?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue with reduced salivation",
      "Hyperacusis due to loss of stapedius reflex",
      "Hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis",
      "Ageusia of the posterior one-third of the tongue",
      "Dry eye from decreased lacrimation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue with reduced salivation. Otosclerosis is an abnormal bony overgrowth near the stapes that produces conductive hearing loss; when severe, it is treated with a stapedectomy. During this middle-ear surgery, the chorda tympani (a branch of CN VII that traverses the tympanic cavity) is at risk; injury causes loss of anterior two-thirds taste and reduced submandibular/sublingual salivation. Explanations for other choices: Hyperacusis due to loss of stapedius reflex is incorrect here because stapedius (CN VII) dysfunction produces sound intolerance but does not explain the taste and salivary deficits most specific to chorda tympani injury; moreover, the stem points to stapedectomy where chorda tympani injury is the classic complication to suspect. Hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis is unrelated to middle-ear surgery. Ageusia of the posterior one-third of the tongue would reflect glossopharyngeal nerve injury, which supplies the internal surface of the tympanic membrane and middle-ear mucosa but is not the structure classically endangered by stapedectomy instrumentation around the stapes and oval window. Dry eye from decreased lacrimation involves greater petrosal nerve pathways and is not the typical risk from surgical manipulation within the tympanic cavity. Together, the scenario’s conductive pattern and treatment link to otosclerosis and stapedectomy; the most specific postoperative deficit to watch for is chorda tympani injury."

    "question": "During an otoscopic exam, a medical student contacts the medial surface of the patient’s tympanic membrane, eliciting sharp pain. Which cranial nerve carries the predominant sensory fibers from that internal surface?",
    "choices": [
      "Auriculotemporal nerve (V3)",
      "Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)",
      "Auricular branch of the vagus nerve (CN X)",
      "Facial nerve (CN VII), posterior auricular branch",
      "Lesser occipital nerve (C2–C3)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The tympanic membrane has three embryologic layers; its internal surface is continuous with the mucosa of the middle ear and is primarily innervated by CN IX, whereas the external surface is skin continuous with the external acoustic meatus and is supplied mainly by V3 with a contribution from the auricular branch of the vagus. Contacting the medial (internal) surface stimulates CN IX afferents. Explanations for other choices: Auriculotemporal nerve (V3) is the dominant cutaneous innervation of the external surface of the membrane and the lateral canal, not the internal surface. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve contributes to external surface sensation and canal skin but is not the primary innervation of the medial surface. The facial nerve posterior auricular branch and the lesser occipital nerve supply parts of the external ear, not the medial tympanic surface. "

    "question": "A 63-year-old man reports brief episodes of spinning vertigo triggered by rolling over in bed. The Dix–Hallpike maneuver reproduces his vertigo and nystagmus. Abnormal stimulation of which specific sensory structure best explains his symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Macula of the utricle",
      "Macula of the saccule",
      "Crista ampullaris of the posterior semicircular duct",
      "Crista ampullaris of the lateral semicircular duct",
      "Organ of Corti within the cochlear duct"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Crista ampullaris of the posterior semicircular duct. In benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the Dix–Hallpike maneuver positions otoconia within the posterior semicircular canal to maximally stimulate the canal, producing vertigo and nystagmus. The sensory end organ of each semicircular duct is the crista ampullaris; endolymph movement deflects the cupula and hair bundles on these mechanosensory cells, signaling angular acceleration to the vestibular nuclei. Explanations for other choices: The maculae of the utricle and saccule detect gravity and linear acceleration, not angular acceleration during head rotations; they are not the structures maximally stimulated in Dix–Hallpike testing. The crista ampullaris of the lateral canal mediates angular acceleration in its plane, but the classic Dix–Hallpike maneuver targets the posterior canal rather than the lateral canal. The Organ of Corti is the auditory receptor within the cochlear duct and is unrelated to vestibular positional vertigo.}"

  "question": "A 54-year-old man is comatose after ventricular fibrillation arrest. As part of a brainstem exam, ice-cold water is irrigated into the right external acoustic meatus: both eyes slowly deviate to the right without a corrective fast phase. When warm water is irrigated into the left ear, there is no eye movement. Which lesion most directly explains these caloric test findings?",
  "choices": [
    "Bilateral frontal eye field damage with intact pontine vestibular pathways",
    "Left vestibular apparatus or vestibular nerve lesion (peripheral afferent loss)",
    "Right abducens nucleus lesion in the dorsal pons",
    "Bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesions",
    "Left oculomotor nucleus lesion"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is Left vestibular apparatus or vestibular nerve lesion (peripheral afferent loss). Caloric testing drives the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) by changing endolymph flow in the lateral semicircular canal, altering firing in the ipsilateral vestibular nerve and nucleus. In an awake patient, the fast phase defines nystagmus and follows the COWS rule (Cold Opposite, Warm Same for the fast phase). The slow phase is the brainstem VOR output and is opposite the fast phase. In a comatose patient with intact brainstem but impaired cortex, the slow phase persists while the fast phase is absent. Right ear cold in this patient produces an appropriate slow deviation toward the irrigated ear (to the right) with no fast phase, indicating an intact right-sided afferent limb (right labyrinth/vestibular nerve) and intact central VOR pathways. However, left ear warm fails to produce any slow deviation (which should be away from the irrigated ear in coma), localizing the problem to the left afferent limb (left labyrinth or vestibular nerve). Thus, the pattern of an intact response on one side and absent response on the other points to a unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion on the nonresponding (left) side. Explanations for other choices: Bilateral frontal eye field damage abolishes the fast (cortical) phase but preserves the slow brainstem VOR on both sides; it cannot explain a unilateral absence of the slow phase. A right abducens nucleus lesion would impair rightward conjugate movements (via right LR and left MR through the MLF), which contradicts the observed normal rightward slow deviation during right cold irrigation. Bilateral MLF lesions (internuclear ophthalmoplegia) disrupt adduction in conjugate gaze and also degrade VOR-mediated adduction, typically producing disconjugate—not absent—eye movements during caloric testing; they do not selectively abolish responses to stimulation from one ear only. A left oculomotor nucleus lesion would primarily impair movements of the left eye (adduction, elevation, depression) and might yield asymmetric or disconjugate responses, but it would not eliminate all eye movement to left-ear warm irrigation; the right eye would still show abduction if the afferent limb were intact. The unilateral absence of any movement specifically implicates failure of the left vestibular afferent input rather than a central gaze or oculomotor nucleus problem."

"question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with acute, continuous vertigo, nausea, and imbalance that began this morning after a recent upper respiratory infection. Bedside head-impulse testing is abnormal when the head is rapidly rotated to the right. She has spontaneous horizontal–torsional nystagmus that is unidirectional and decreases with visual fixation; there is no vertical skew on alternate cover testing. She can stand and walk with assistance. Which overall pattern best supports a peripheral acute vestibular neuritis rather than a posterior circulation stroke?",
"choices": [
"Abnormal head-impulse test; unidirectional horizontal–torsional nystagmus that suppresses with fixation; no skew deviation; able to ambulate",
"Normal head-impulse test; bidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus not suppressed by fixation; skew deviation present; unable to stand",
"Normal head-impulse test; unidirectional nystagmus that suppresses with fixation; no skew deviation; falls in any direction",
"Abnormal head-impulse test; pure vertical nystagmus; skew deviation present; unable to ambulate",
"Abnormal head-impulse test; acute vertigo with ipsilateral hearing loss; unable to stand even with support"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because the HINTS-plus bedside pattern for a peripheral vestibulopathy includes an abnormal head-impulse test indicating impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex on the affected side, unidirectional horizontal–torsional nystagmus that lessens with fixation, no vertical skew deviation, and relative preservation of the ability to ambulate with support. Choice 1 is incorrect because a normal head-impulse test with bidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus, skew deviation, and inability to stand is concerning for a central lesion such as posterior circulation stroke. Choice 2 is incorrect because a normal head-impulse test shifts suspicion away from peripheral neuritis toward central causes despite other peripheral-appearing features. Choice 3 is incorrect because pure vertical nystagmus and skew deviation strongly suggest central pathology. Choice 4 is incorrect because the combination of acute vertigo with hearing loss and profound imbalance points to an AICA territory stroke or labyrinthine ischemia rather than isolated vestibular neuritis."

"question": "A 70-year-old man reports brief episodes of room-spinning dizziness when rolling over in bed or looking up. Neurologic examination is normal. Dix–Hallpike testing with the head turned to the left reproduces symptoms and elicits torsional–upbeating nystagmus that begins after a short latency, lasts about 15 seconds, and fatigues with repetition. Which mechanism best explains his disorder?",
"choices": [
"Canalithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal from free-floating otoconia that abnormally deflect the cupula with position changes",
"Orthostatic hypotension causing transient global cerebral hypoperfusion without canal-specific nystagmus",
"Central positional vertigo due to cerebellar lesion producing sustained nystagmus without latency or fatigability",
"Vestibular neuritis causing continuous spontaneous vertigo unrelated to specific head positions",
"Ménière disease causing endolymphatic hydrops with episodic vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because benign paroxysmal positional vertigo most commonly involves posterior canal canalithiasis, in which mobile otoconia enter the canal and, with positional changes, cause transient endolymph flow that deflects the cupula and produces brief, delayed-onset, fatigable torsional–vertical nystagmus on Dix–Hallpike. Choice 1 is incorrect because orthostatic hypotension causes presyncope rather than canal-specific nystagmus and is not reliably triggered by the Dix–Hallpike maneuver. Choice 2 is incorrect because central positional nystagmus is typically immediate, persistent, and often purely vertical or purely horizontal without fatigability, unlike the classic posterior canal pattern here. Choice 3 is incorrect because vestibular neuritis produces continuous vertigo over hours to days, not brief, position-triggered spells. Choice 4 is incorrect because Ménière disease features vertigo with auditory symptoms such as fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, which are absent in this presentation."

"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction with labyrinthine involvement",
"Isolated vestibular neuritis",
"Thiamine deficiency causing central vestibulopathy",
"Multiple sclerosis plaque affecting the brainstem",
"Bacterial labyrinthitis without central involvement"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because a combined acute audio-vestibular presentation (vertigo plus ipsilateral hearing loss) with profound postural instability strongly suggests an AICA territory infarct that can compromise the labyrinthine artery and adjacent cerebellar or brainstem structures. Choice 1 is incorrect because vestibular neuritis is an isolated vestibular nerve disorder without hearing loss, and patients can usually ambulate with support. Choice 2 is incorrect because thiamine deficiency can cause central vestibular signs but does not typically present as a sudden combined audio-vestibular syndrome with inability to stand. Choice 3 is incorrect because multiple sclerosis can affect central vestibular pathways but is less likely to cause abrupt audio-vestibular loss with such severe imbalance in this pattern. Choice 4 is incorrect because bacterial labyrinthitis often follows otitis media or meningitis and, while it can cause hearing loss and vertigo, the profound gait inability in this hyperacute vascular pattern is more characteristic of AICA stroke."

"question": "A 38-year-old woman reports that when asked to show her teeth, she produces a full symmetric smile. However, when told a funny joke, the right lower half of her face fails to elevate. Corneal reflexes and facial sensation are intact. Which lesion best explains this dissociation?",
"choices": [
"Right corticobulbar fibers projecting to the facial motor nucleus",
"Left limbic cortex affecting descending emotional facial pathways",
"Left facial nerve lesion at the stylomastoid foramen",
"Bilateral degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta",
"Right facial motor nucleus in the pons"
],
"correctAnswer": 1,
"explanation": "The correct answer is Left limbic cortex affecting descending emotional facial pathways. This is emotional facial paresis: voluntary (pyramidal) smile is intact but spontaneous Duchenne smile is lost on the contralateral lower face, implicating a lesion in limbic circuitry of the opposite hemisphere that normally drives emotional facial expression through basal ganglia and brainstem facial motor nuclei. Right corticobulbar fibers are incorrect because damage there produces voluntary facial hemiparesis of the contralateral lower face with preserved spontaneous emotional smiling, the opposite pattern. Left facial nerve lesion at the stylomastoid foramen is incorrect because it would cause ipsilateral flaccid weakness of both voluntary and emotional movements, not selective loss of spontaneous emotion with preserved voluntary control. Bilateral degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta is incorrect because Parkinson disease causes hypomimia or masked facies with reduced spontaneous expressivity globally, but it would not produce a strictly unilateral dissociation with normal on-command symmetry. Right facial motor nucleus lesion is incorrect because it would produce ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness affecting both voluntary and emotional movements, typically with additional brainstem signs rather than an isolated dissociation."

"Superior colliculus projects to the facial motor nucleus to mediate the entire fear reaction independent of limbic circuits"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is Thalamus relays crude visual input directly to the amygdala for a rapid response, then detailed cortical processing (visual cortex and associative areas) converges on the amygdala to refine the response; hypothalamus is engaged via ventral amygdalofugal projections. The fast low-road provides a quick, coarse signal to the amygdala that prioritizes survival by rapidly engaging autonomic output through hypothalamus, while the slow high-road integrates precise cortical analysis to modulate or abort the response when the stimulus is identified as safe. Hippocampus to mammillary body to anterior thalamus to cingulate circuit is incorrect because this is the classic Papez circuit related to memory and affect but does not account for the amygdala-driven rapid autonomic surge that precedes conscious appraisal. Basal ganglia motor loop is incorrect because it primarily modulates voluntary motor programs and habit learning rather than initiating the immediate autonomic fear response; limbic basal ganglia loops shape motivated actions but the initial autonomic surge is amygdala to hypothalamus. Primary visual cortex to striatum to hypothalamus is incorrect because there is no direct canonical pathway that bypasses the amygdala to trigger sympathetic output in this context; hypothalamic activation from emotional salience is classically driven by amygdala efferents. Superior colliculus to facial motor nucleus is incorrect because while collicular circuits can mediate orienting and startle-like movements, the hallmark autonomic features and the rapid fear experience require amygdala and hypothalamic engagement."

"question": "Researchers test whether blocking a specific neuromodulatory system alters consolidation of emotionally arousing material. Healthy volunteers hear a three-part story with an emotional middle segment; half receive an antagonist of the relevant neurotransmitter during the consolidation window.

Which nucleus was most likely targeted by the antagonist to abolish emotion-enhanced memory?",
"choices": [
"Locus coeruleus",
"Nucleus basalis of Meynert",
"Dorsal raphe nuclei",
"Ventral tegmental area",
"Tuberomammillary nucleus"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is Locus coeruleus. Norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus enhances arousal and facilitates consolidation of emotionally salient memories by modulating amygdala and hippocampal processing, with an inverted U-shaped dose–effect relationship; antagonism during consolidation blunts the usual emotional memory advantage while leaving neutral memory relatively spared. Nucleus basalis of Meynert is incorrect because cholinergic projections promote cortical arousal and attention broadly, and blockade may impair alertness but is less specifically tied to the selective enhancement of emotional memory consolidation mediated by amygdala–hippocampal interactions. Dorsal raphe nuclei are incorrect because serotonin is central to mood and sleep regulation; acutely altering serotonin could affect affective state, but the canonical neuromodulator for emotion-linked memory consolidation in this setting is norepinephrine. Ventral tegmental area is incorrect because dopamine from the VTA signals reward and salience for reinforcement learning and motivation; while dopamine can influence memory, the classic effect on emotional episodic consolidation following arousing stimuli is attributed primarily to noradrenergic signaling. Tuberomammillary nucleus is incorrect because histamine contributes to general arousal and wakefulness but is not the key neuromodulator mediating the amygdala-dependent boost in consolidation for emotional events."

He reports that sounds are equally loud in both ears but he now struggles to tell where sounds originate, especially in noisy environments. Which unilateral lesion best explains his deficit?",
"choices": [
"Right superior olivary complex",
"Right cochlear nerve proximal to the cochlea",
"Right cochlear nucleus at the pontomedullary junction",
"Right lateral lemniscus in the pons",
"Right medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is Right superior olivary complex. The superior olivary nuclei are the first site of binaural integration and are critical for sound localization by comparing interaural time and intensity differences. Because each cochlear nucleus projects bilaterally into the ascending auditory pathways, unilateral lesions above the cochlear nuclei typically do not cause unilateral hearing loss but do impair localization and complex processing. Choice 1 is incorrect because a lesion of the cochlear nerve is a peripheral lesion that produces ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss, abnormal tuning-fork tests, and reduced thresholds on audiometry. Choice 2 is incorrect because a unilateral cochlear nucleus lesion is still peripheral in this schema and causes ipsilateral hearing loss, not isolated localization difficulty. Choice 3 is incorrect because although the lateral lemniscus is a central pathway and unilateral lesions there usually spare gross hearing thresholds, its hallmark is not as specifically tied to localization as the superior olivary complex; deficits are more general to temporal processing of sound. Choice 4 is incorrect because the medial geniculate nucleus is a thalamic relay for auditory information to cortex; unilateral MGN lesions usually spare basic hearing and may cause cortical-level processing problems (e.g., filtering), but the primary brainstem computation of localization arises in the superior olive, making that the best answer for this classic presentation."

"choices": [
"Outer hair cells at the basal turn of the Organ of Corti",

"Stria vascularis of the scala media uniformly along the cochlea",
"Stapedius muscle at the stapes–oval window interface",
"Round window membrane of the scala tympani"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is Outer hair cells at the basal turn of the Organ of Corti. Ototoxic agents such as aminoglycosides characteristically produce high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss first, reflecting vulnerability of the basal cochlea where high frequencies are encoded. Outer hair cells act as the cochlear amplifier via prestin-mediated electromotility; damage to these cells elevates thresholds and disproportionately impairs speech clarity for high-frequency consonants. Choice 1 is incorrect because inner hair cells are the primary afferent transducers but are not the earliest and most prominent target in classic aminoglycoside ototoxicity; the basal outer hair cells fail first. Choice 2 is incorrect because although the stria vascularis maintains endolymph composition and the endocochlear potential, the presentation of an early high-frequency notch is most classically linked to basal outer hair cell injury rather than a uniform strial dysfunction. Choice 3 is incorrect because stapedius dysfunction yields hyperacusis (sound intolerance) rather than a selective high-frequency sensorineural pattern on audiometry. Choice 4 is incorrect because the round window is a pressure-release interface; pathology here would more likely contribute to conductive or mixed patterns, not the characteristic high-frequency sensorineural notch seen with hair cell toxicity."

The pedigree here shows unaffected parents with multiple affected relatives and no syndromic features, consistent with a recessive, non-syndromic etiology. Choice 1 is incorrect because PAX3 mutations produce Waardenburg type I with characteristic pigmentary and craniofacial findings; the absence of syndromic features and the apparent recessive inheritance pattern argue against this. Choice 2 is incorrect because MITF-related Waardenburg type II is also autosomal dominant and typically shows pigmentary abnormalities; again, the family pattern and exam do not fit. Choice 3 is incorrect because KCNQ4 mutations cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss that tends to be progressive across generations; a dominant pattern would show vertical transmission to affected parents. Choice 4 is incorrect because mitochondrial mutations show maternal inheritance affecting all children of an affected mother; the stem does not indicate matrilineal transmission or aminoglycoside exposure and instead suggests a classic autosomal recessive cluster."

"question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with painful monocular vision loss and color desaturation in the right eye; a relative afferent pupillary defect is present. MRI of the brain shows three ovoid T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions: two periventricular and one juxtacortical. MRI of the orbits shows T2 hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement of the right optic nerve. CSF demonstrates oligoclonal bands restricted to the CSF. Aquaporin-4 and MOG antibodies are negative, and alternative diagnoses have been reasonably excluded. According to the 2017 McDonald criteria, which statement is most accurate?",
"choices": [
"She does not meet dissemination in space because optic nerve lesions cannot be counted, so no diagnosis can be made until a follow-up MRI shows new lesions for dissemination in time",
"She meets dissemination in space with periventricular and juxtacortical lesions and meets dissemination in time because CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands now fulfill DIT, so a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be made at this visit",
"She meets dissemination in time due to an enhancing optic nerve lesion and nonenhancing brain lesions on the same scan, but dissemination in space is not met because infratentorial or spinal cord involvement is required",
"A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires at least two clinical attacks regardless of MRI and CSF, so she cannot be diagnosed yet",
"CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands are nonspecific and cannot be used to establish dissemination in time in the current criteria"
],
"correctAnswer": 1,
"explanation": "Choice 1 is correct. Dissemination in space is satisfied by at least one characteristic T2 lesion in two or more typical locations; periventricular and juxtacortical lesions meet this requirement, and optic nerve lesions do not need to be counted. Dissemination in time can be established either by new T2 or enhancing lesions relative to a baseline scan or by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, which the 2017 McDonald criteria accept as fulfilling DIT. Therefore, with DIS and DIT both met and other causes reasonably excluded, multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed now. Choice 0 is incorrect because DIS is already met by periventricular and juxtacortical lesions; the rule that optic nerve lesions do not count applies only to not using them to meet DIS, not to negating brain lesions that already meet DIS. Choice 2 is incorrect because DIS does not require infratentorial or spinal cord lesions if other characteristic locations are involved; additionally, DIT can be fulfilled by CSF oligoclonal bands even without simultaneous enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. Choice 3 is incorrect because modern criteria allow diagnosis after a single clinical attack when DIS and DIT are demonstrated by MRI and/or CSF. Choice 4 is incorrect because CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands are explicitly allowed to fulfill DIT under the 2017 criteria."

She also had intractable hiccups and vomiting two months earlier; MRI showed a dorsal medullary lesion at the area postrema. Serum testing is positive for aquaporin-4 antibodies. Which combination of pathologic mechanism and imaging pattern best accounts for her disease and distinguishes it from multiple sclerosis?",

"Microvascular small-vessel ischemic changes causing scattered subcortical punctate lesions without opticospinal predilection",
"Perivenous demyelination with frequent persistent T1 black holes and progressive disability between attacks"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Aquaporin-4–IgG–positive NMOSD is an astrocytopathy characterized by complement-mediated injury to AQP4-rich astrocytic endfeet, producing clinical syndromes such as severe optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and area postrema syndrome; demyelination is secondary. Imaging often shows cord lesions extending three or more vertebral segments and periependymal brainstem lesions at the area postrema, features not typical of multiple sclerosis. Choice 1 describes classic multiple sclerosis, which is primarily an inflammatory demyelinating disease with periventricular and juxtacortical plaques and does not characteristically produce LETM or area postrema attacks. Choice 2 describes MOG antibody disease, which may involve conus and can be monophasic or relapsing; it lacks the astrocytopathy and complement deposition that define aquaporin-4–mediated disease and is not confined to children. Choice 3 describes nonspecific microvascular disease that would not explain severe opticospinal attacks or area postrema syndrome. Choice 4 describes ADEM features such as perivenous demyelination and is incorrect because persistent black holes and progressive disability between attacks better fit chronic MS and not NMOSD."

"question": "A 7-year-old boy develops fever and headache after an upper respiratory infection and then presents with confusion, irritability, ataxia, and weakness in all extremities. MRI reveals large, bilateral, poorly demarcated deep and subcortical white matter lesions with additional involvement of the thalami; periventricular white matter appears relatively spared. CSF shows mild pleocytosis and elevated protein without restricted oligoclonal bands. Which follow-up finding would most strongly support the suspected diagnosis over multiple sclerosis?",
"choices": [
"Resolution of most lesions on repeat MRI with no new clinical events or new MRI lesions at or beyond three months",
"Appearance of a new enhancing periventricular lesion within two months",
"Development of multiple persistent T1 black holes on six-month imaging",
"Emergence of a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis within one month",
"Seroconversion to aquaporin-4–IgG positivity"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. The presentation is classic for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which requires a first multifocal CNS event with encephalopathy, typically postinfectious, with large bilateral poorly demarcated lesions that often involve deep gray matter; CSF oligoclonal bands are uncommon. Supportive evolution includes radiographic resolution of most lesions and absence of new clinical or MRI events after the acute phase, helping distinguish ADEM from multiple sclerosis. Choice 1 would argue for dissemination in time consistent with evolving MS rather than monophasic ADEM. Choice 2 suggests chronic destructive MS pathology; black holes are unusual in ADEM and their presence is predictive of MS. Choice 3 could occur in NMOSD or occasionally MOGAD and does not support ADEM. Choice 4 would indicate aquaporin-4–mediated NMOSD rather than ADEM."

"Normal delayed recall of a complex story but impaired improvement on repeated mirror-tracing attempts",
"Global loss of remote autobiographical memories from childhood with normal new learning"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because bilateral hippocampal CA1 injury selectively disrupts encoding and consolidation of new declarative episodic memories, producing anterograde amnesia with poor delayed recall, while working memory (digit span, prefrontal circuits) and procedural learning (mirror tracing, cerebellum and basal ganglia) are spared. Choice 1 is incorrect because digit span reflects working memory rather than hippocampal function and is typically preserved in pure hippocampal amnesia. Choice 2 is incorrect because mirror-tracing relies on procedural memory networks, not hippocampus, and should be intact. Choice 3 is incorrect because hippocampal damage impairs delayed recall of narratives even when attention is adequate; procedural improvement should remain. Choice 4 is incorrect because remote autobiographical memory is often relatively spared early due to cortical consolidation and Ribot’s law, whereas new learning is impaired."

Choice 1 is incorrect because the uncinate fasciculus mediates orbitofrontal–temporal association functions such as social and semantic processing, not the core declarative memory circuit. Choice 2 is incorrect because the stria terminalis carries amygdala outputs to hypothalamus and septal areas for autonomic and motivational responses, not declarative memory consolidation. Choice 3 is incorrect because the anterior commissure primarily interconnects temporal neocortex and olfactory regions but is not the critical bottleneck for episodic memory consolidation. Choice 4 is incorrect because periaqueductal gray projections modulate pain and autonomic reactions and are not central to the Papez memory pathway."

"choices": [
"Piriform cortex in the anterior medial temporal lobe",

"Primary somatosensory cortex via the ventral posteromedial nucleus",

"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because the lateral olfactory tract projects directly from the olfactory bulb to primary olfactory (piriform) cortex as well as adjacent limbic structures including amygdala and entorhinal cortex, bypassing a thalamic relay and providing a substrate for olfactory auras in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Choice 1 is incorrect because while olfactory information can reach orbitofrontal cortex via the mediodorsal thalamus for higher-order processing, the primary limbic olfactory input does not require thalamic relay. Choice 2 is incorrect because the ventral posteromedial nucleus relays somatosensory, not olfactory, input. Choice 3 is incorrect because the nucleus accumbens participates in reward and motivation circuits and does not receive direct bulb projections.

"question": "A 36-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis misses several infusion appointments and reports low mood, anhedonia, poor sleep, and passive thoughts of death. She denies a plan or intent. The clinic wants to reduce safety risk and improve treatment adherence. Which single next step best aligns with best practices emphasized for MS care?",
"choices": [
"Initiate routine depression screening at every neurology visit with a validated tool and provide rapid referral for combined psychotherapy and antidepressant treatment with safety planning",
"Increase her disease-modifying therapy dose first to regain inflammatory control; address mood after 3 months if adherence improves",
"Reassure her that mood symptoms are common in MS and provide an educational pamphlet about coping strategies",
"Advise passive acceptance of her diagnosis and to avoid discussing distressing thoughts to prevent rumination",
"Schedule less frequent neurology follow-ups to decrease medical burden and thereby reduce distress"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is choice 0. Depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in MS and are associated with worse adherence and higher suicide risk; clinics should perform routine depression screening and offer timely treatment, with combination therapy (psychotherapy plus antidepressants) often most effective, alongside a safety plan when passive suicidal ideation is disclosed. Choice 1 is incorrect because escalating immunotherapy without addressing active depression and adherence barriers fails to treat the driver of nonadherence and safety risk. Choice 2 is insufficient; education alone does not address high-risk symptoms or improve adherence as effectively as structured screening and treatment. Choice 3 mischaracterizes acceptance; the lecture frames acceptance as active, not passive, and discourages avoidance. Choice 4 reduces clinical contact when closer monitoring and integrated behavioral health support are indicated."

He endorses daytime fatigue, trouble concentrating, slowed information processing, and worry about injections should his regimen change. He recently withdrew from his cycling group and spends weekends in bed. Which targeted plan best addresses the combined emotional, cognitive, and behavioral barriers to adherence outlined in the lecture?",
"choices": [
"Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety and needle-related fear plus behavioral activation using a structured plan (ABC PLEASE), energy-conservation strategies for fatigue, and cognitive supports such as pill organizers and phone reminders",
"Switch to a less frequent injectable disease-modifying therapy and reassess adherence in 6 months without additional interventions",
"Recommend he read online patient forums and return if his mood worsens",
"Prescribe a sedating hypnotic nightly to improve sleep without other changes",
"Ask a family member to assume full control of his medications to eliminate missed doses"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "The correct answer is choice 0. The lecture emphasizes that adherence problems in MS are multifactorial: emotional (depression, anxiety), cognitive (memory, attention, processing speed), and behavioral (fatigue, avoidance, social withdrawal). A multicomponent plan pairing CBT for anxiety, behavioral activation and resilience practices (ABC PLEASE: accumulate positives, build mastery, cope ahead; plus treating physical illness, balanced eating, avoiding mood-altering drugs, balancing sleep, and exercise), energy-conservation/pacing for fatigue, and cognitive supports (reminders, organizers, simplification) directly targets each barrier. Choice 1 may reduce dosing burden but ignores the active emotional and cognitive contributors to nonadherence. Choice 2 lacks structured skill-building and may perpetuate isolation. Choice 3 treats a symptom (sleep) without addressing mood, cognition, or daytime activation and risks next-day sedation. Choice 4 risks learned helplessness and does not build the patient’s skills; supportive involvement is helpful, but wholesale transfer of control is not the recommended first-line strategy."

"choices": [
"Enroll in a structured MS support group or group therapy to meet peers, obtain multiple perspectives, challenge inaccurate beliefs, learn effective strategies, and decrease isolation",
"Practice total self-reliance by avoiding discussion of MS to prevent burdening others",

The lecture highlights structured support (MS support groups and group therapy) as a way to reduce isolation, gain multiple perspectives, challenge inaccurate or unhelpful beliefs, learn what works from others, and practice skills, thereby improving coping and identity recovery. Choice 1 promotes isolation and deprives her of social support, which is linked to poorer outcomes. Choice 2 reflects a maladaptive coping pattern (perfectionism, overcontrol) associated with higher distress. Choice 3 delays care and reinforces invalidation; early engagement improves adjustment.

"question": "A 27-year-old woman with focal epilepsy is well controlled on lamotrigine. She stops her combined estrogen-containing oral contraceptive to try to conceive and, two weeks later, her psychiatrist adds valproate for bipolar symptoms. Within a month she develops dizziness, diplopia, and a diffuse morbilliform rash. Which pharmacokinetic explanation best accounts for her new toxicity risk?",
"choices": [
"Estrogen removal and valproate coadministration both increase lamotrigine exposure by reducing its metabolism",
"Stopping estrogen increases lamotrigine clearance, while valproate decreases it, resulting in no net change",
"Valproate displaces lamotrigine from plasma proteins, lowering free drug concentrations",
"Estrogen withdrawal directly increases GABAergic tone, which mimics lamotrigine toxicity",
"Valproate induces hepatic enzymes that accelerate lamotrigine clearance"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Correct: Estrogen removal and valproate coadministration both increase lamotrigine exposure by reducing its metabolism. Estrogens lower lamotrigine levels; stopping estrogen removes this effect, raising lamotrigine concentrations. Valproate further increases lamotrigine by inhibiting its metabolism. Together, these changes heighten lamotrigine toxicity risk including rash. Incorrect choices: Stopping estrogen increases, not decreases, lamotrigine levels, so it does not offset valproate’s metabolic inhibition. Valproate’s interaction is metabolic, not protein displacement. Estrogen withdrawal does not cause lamotrigine-like toxicity via GABAergic mechanisms; lamotrigine acts primarily via Na+ channel inactivation. Valproate is not an inducer; it inhibits and also has multiple mechanisms including Na+ and T-type Ca2+ effects. "

Which agent best minimizes the risks highlighted by her comorbidities and pharmacogenetics?",
"choices": [
"Carbamazepine",
"Oxcarbazepine",
"Levetiracetam",
"Topiramate",
"Valproate"
],
"correctAnswer": 2,
"explanation": "Correct: Levetiracetam. It does not carry the HLA-B1502–associated SJS risk, is not a strong hepatic enzyme inducer that would reduce warfarin or oral contraceptive effectiveness, and requires renal dosing rather than complex hepatic adjustments. Carbamazepine is incorrect because it is associated with a markedly increased risk of SJS/TEN in HLA-B1502 carriers and is a potent enzyme inducer that lowers warfarin and oral contraceptive levels. Oxcarbazepine is incorrect because although it induces enzymes less than carbamazepine, it still carries increased SJS risk in HLA-B1502 carriers and can cause significant hyponatremia. Topiramate is incorrect because it can cause cognitive side effects, renal stones, and metabolic acidosis and is not the cleanest choice for a patient dependent on oral contraceptives and warfarin management. Valproate is incorrect due to teratogenicity concerns in a woman planning pregnancy and endocrine effects, and it is not needed here given safer alternatives. "

His clinician increases the daily dose by 50 mg. One week later he returns with nystagmus, gait ataxia, and lethargy. Albumin is 2.4 g/dL. Which mechanism best explains his abrupt toxicity after a seemingly small dose increase?",
"choices": [
"Saturable hepatic metabolism leading to disproportionate increases in phenytoin levels plus low albumin increasing free drug",
"Induction of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 leading to accumulation of active metabolites",
"Antacid coadministration increased phenytoin bioavailability by 20 percent",
"Enhanced renal reabsorption of phenytoin due to metabolic acidosis",
"Displacement of phenytoin from albumin by valproate, which always lowers total levels while reducing free concentrations"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Correct: Saturable hepatic metabolism leading to disproportionate increases in phenytoin levels plus low albumin increasing free drug. Phenytoin exhibits nonlinear Michaelis–Menten kinetics; small dose increases can cause large rises in serum concentration. Toxicity signs appear around and above 20–40 mcg/mL. Its high albumin binding means hypoalbuminemia increases the free fraction, amplifying toxicity at a given total level. Incorrect choices: Phenytoin is a broad CYP inducer; it is not metabolized to active metabolites that accumulate via induction. Antacids are noted to reduce, not increase, bioavailability of gabapentin, not phenytoin; this does not explain phenytoin toxicity. Renal handling is not the primary driver of phenytoin kinetics. Valproate can displace protein-bound drugs and inhibit metabolism, but the stem gives no valproate use; moreover, displacement increases free levels (worsening toxicity), not lowers them. "

A roommate reports the patient first turned his head and eyes to the left, his left arm stiffened and shook, and 30 seconds later the whole body stiffened and jerked. Afterward, the patient was confused and had transient weakness of the left arm for 10 minutes. He recalls an intense rising sensation in his stomach right before the event. Which seizure type best explains this presentation?",
"choices": [
"Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure",
"Generalized tonic-clonic seizure",
"Typical absence seizure",
"Focal preserved-consciousness seizure",
"Myoclonic seizure"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures often begin with focal signs (e.g., versive head/eye deviation), may have an aura (a focal seizure), and commonly produce postictal confusion or Todd’s paresis once bilateral convulsions occur. These features are prototypical of FBTC. Choice 1 is incorrect because generalized tonic-clonic seizures start bilaterally at onset and characteristically lack an aura, lack early forced head/eye turning to one side, and do not produce Todd’s paresis; postictal confusion is common but not diagnostic without the focal features seen here. Choice 2 is incorrect because typical absence occurs mainly in children/teens, is brief (<30 s), often triggered by hyperventilation, and shows no aura, no postictal confusion, and no Todd’s paresis; the EEG hallmark is generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave. Choice 3 is incorrect because a focal preserved-consciousness seizure (formerly simple partial) would not evolve to bilateral tonic-clonic activity and usually lacks postictal confusion; Todd’s paresis can follow focal motor seizures, but the bilateral convulsion indicates spread beyond an isolated FPC. Choice 4 is incorrect because myoclonic seizures are brief, shock-like jerks, often symmetric and generalized, frequently associated with generalized epilepsies; they do not typically present with a focal aura, versive head/eye deviation, or postictal unilateral weakness.

"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Auras such as metallic taste, déjà vu, olfactory/gustatory hallucinations, or a rising epigastric sensation are focal seizures that commonly localize to the mesial temporal lobe; their presence argues against typical absence, which by definition lacks focal auras. Choices 1–4 are typical of absence and therefore incorrect: typical absence lasts under 30 seconds, is often provoked by hyperventilation, shows generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave on EEG, has no postictal confusion or Todd’s paresis, and may occur many times per day.

"choices": [
"Repeat EEG or obtain a longer-duration EEG recording to improve sensitivity",
"Rely on the single normal routine EEG to exclude epilepsy",
"Order brain MRI only, because EEG will not change management",
"Diagnose psychogenic nonepileptic events and stop further testing",
"Perform only hyperventilation testing in clinic without EEG"

"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Routine ~30-minute EEGs have limited sensitivity (about 29–55%) for interictal epileptiform discharges; repeating EEG or extending the recording markedly increases yield (approx. 82–92%). Longer recording duration improves sensitivity. Choice 1 is incorrect because a single normal routine EEG does not exclude epilepsy given its modest sensitivity. Choice 2 is incomplete; MRI evaluates structural etiologies but does not replace EEG for detecting epileptiform activity or classifying seizure onset. Choice 3 is premature; PNES is a diagnosis requiring appropriate evaluation and is not supported by a single normal EEG after a suspected unprovoked seizure. Choice 4 is incorrect because hyperventilation can provoke generalized absence seizures but, without EEG recording, it does not assess for interictal epileptiform discharges in this adult with a first unprovoked event.

"Lower the lamotrigine dose to reduce adverse effects unmasked by estrogen"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct because estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase lamotrigine clearance, often necessitating a higher lamotrigine dose to restore seizure control; dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response and, when available, serum levels. Choice 1 is incorrect because carbamazepine is a strong hepatic enzyme inducer that can reduce oral contraceptive effectiveness and adds interaction burden. Choice 2 is incorrect because valproate inhibits lamotrigine metabolism, increasing risk of serious rash and other toxicity; using it solely to raise lamotrigine levels is unsafe. Choice 3 is premature; contraception can be continued with appropriate lamotrigine dose titration rather than stopping an effective family-planning method. Choice 4 is the opposite of what is needed; estrogen lowers lamotrigine exposure, so decreasing the dose would worsen control. "

"question": "An 81-year-old man in a nursing facility develops a new focal-onset seizure disorder after a lacunar stroke. History is significant for liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, open-angle glaucoma, a prior calcium oxalate kidney stone, and polypharmacy. Which antiseizure medication is the best initial choice?",
"choices": [
"Levetiracetam",
"Phenytoin",
"Carbamazepine",
"Valproic acid",
"Topiramate"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Levetiracetam is correct because it is effective for focal seizures, is generally well tolerated in older adults, has minimal drug–drug interactions, and is renally cleared, avoiding the patient’s hepatic impairment. Phenytoin is incorrect because it is a hepatic enzyme inducer, has complex nonlinear kinetics, and can worsen glycemic control by decreasing insulin secretion. Carbamazepine is incorrect due to strong CYP3A4 induction with many interactions in a polypharmacy patient and risks such as hyponatremia. Valproic acid is incorrect because preexisting liver disease increases the risk of hepatotoxicity. Topiramate is incorrect given this patient’s history of glaucoma and nephrolithiasis; its carbonic anhydrase–inhibiting effect increases risks of acute angle issues and kidney stones. "

"question": "A 58-year-old comatose man after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest undergoes bedside brainstem testing. With ice-cold water in the right ear, both eyes slowly deviate to the right without a fast corrective phase. With warm water in the left ear several minutes later, there is no eye movement. Corneal and pupillary light reflexes are present. Which lesion best explains this caloric test pattern?",
"choices": [
"Left vestibular apparatus or vestibular nerve lesion impairing the afferent limb",
"Bilateral frontal eye field lesions abolishing the fast phase only",
"Right abducens nucleus lesion in the dorsal pons",
"Bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions producing internuclear ophthalmoplegia",
"Cerebellar flocculus lesion impairing gaze-holding"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. In coma with an intact brainstem, caloric irrigation produces the slow tonic eye deviation (brainstem vestibulo-ocular reflex) but the cortical fast corrective phase (nystagmus) is absent. Right cold causing slow deviation toward the irrigated ear proves intact right-sided afferent input and central VOR circuitry. The absence of any slow deviation with left warm localizes to failure of the left afferent limb (labyrinth or vestibular nerve). Choice 1 is incorrect because frontal eye fields generate the fast phase; bilateral cortical damage would abolish fast beats but preserve the slow deviation from intact brainstem pathways in both ears, not selectively one ear. Choice 2 is incorrect because a right abducens nuclear lesion would impair rightward conjugate movements, contradicting the preserved rightward slow deviation with right-ear cold. Choice 3 is incorrect because bilateral MLF lesions cause disconjugate responses (impaired adduction) rather than complete absence of slow deviation to one ear only. Choice 4 is incorrect because cerebellar flocculus dysfunction yields gaze-holding deficits and gaze-evoked nystagmus but does not abolish the brainstem-driven slow phase from one ear’s caloric stimulation.

"question": "A 32-year-old man with an acute right temporal epidural hematoma develops coma with a fixed, dilated right pupil and extensor posturing. He subsequently shows weakness of the right side rather than the left. Which mechanism most directly explains the ipsilateral hemiplegia in this setting?",
"choices": [
"Compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the tentorial edge (Kernohan notch)",
"Infarction of the right occipital lobe from posterior cerebral artery compression",
"Primary destruction of the right corticospinal tract within the internal capsule",
"Ischemia of bilateral thalami from top-of-the-basilar occlusion",
"Dorsal midbrain lesion causing Parinaud syndrome"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Uncal herniation can compress the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (blown pupil) and midbrain reticular activating system (coma). As the medial temporal lobe displaces across the tentorial incisura, the opposite cerebral peduncle can be compressed against the tentorial edge (Kernohan notch), producing a false-localizing ipsilateral hemiplegia. Choice 1 is incorrect because posterior cerebral artery compression explains contralateral homonymous hemianopia, not ipsilateral hemiplegia. Choice 2 is incorrect because a primary internal capsule lesion would cause contralateral weakness; the vignette emphasizes a herniation mechanism with paradoxical ipsilateral findings. Choice 3 is incorrect because top-of-the-basilar events involve rostral brainstem and bilateral thalami causing coma, vertical gaze palsy, and visual syndromes, not the classic uncal herniation triad with a blown pupil and ipsilateral hemiplegia. Choice 4 is incorrect because a dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) lesion yields vertical gaze palsy and light-near dissociation, not the herniation constellation or Kernohan notch phenomenon. "

"question": "A 66-year-old man is found mute and quadriplegic after a basilar artery thrombosis but follows commands by vertical eye movements and blinking. Pupils are reactive; corneal reflexes are intact. Which additional finding best distinguishes locked-in syndrome from top-of-the-basilar syndrome in this clinical context?",
"choices": [
"Preserved consciousness with vertical eye movements indicating ventral pontine damage sparing the midbrain tegmentum in locked-in syndrome",
"Profound coma due to bilateral thalamic and rostral brainstem infarction in locked-in syndrome",
"Complete loss of vertical gaze and ptosis with preserved motor strength in locked-in syndrome",
"Absent corneal and oculocephalic reflexes defining locked-in syndrome as brain death",
"Fixed, dilated pupils due to oculomotor nerve compression as the hallmark of locked-in syndrome"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"explanation": "Choice 0 is correct. Locked-in syndrome results from ventral pontine injury (often basilar occlusion) causing quadriplegia and anarthria with preserved consciousness, vertical eye movements, and blinking (dorsal midbrain and tegmental structures spared). In contrast, top-of-the-basilar syndrome produces coma, vertical gaze palsy, ptosis, amnesia, and cortical visual syndromes due to infarction of rostral brainstem and bilateral thalami, often with preserved limb motor strength. Choice 1 is incorrect because coma with bilateral thalamic involvement characterizes top-of-the-basilar syndrome, not locked-in syndrome. Choice 2 is incorrect because vertical gaze palsy and ptosis are features of top-of-the-basilar lesions; locked-in patients preserve vertical gaze. Choice 3 is incorrect because brainstem reflexes (corneal, oculocephalic) are preserved in locked-in syndrome; their absence suggests brain death or extensive brainstem failure, not LIS. Choice 4 is incorrect because fixed, dilated pupils reflect uncal herniation with oculomotor compression, not the defining feature of locked-in syndrome. "
