  "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of sudden onset facial asymmetry that started this morning. She reports that she woke up unable to move the right side of her face. She is unable to close her right eye, raise her right eyebrow, or smile symmetrically. She denies trauma, recent illness, or limb weakness. On exam, there is drooping of the right side of her face, loss of the nasolabial fold, and inability to fully close the right eye. Sensation over the face is intact. There is no hearing loss or vertigo. The remainder of the neurologic exam is normal.\n\nTwo weeks later, she returns for a follow-up. She has been treated with a short course of corticosteroids. Her facial weakness has partially improved, but now she complains of tearing and eye discomfort due to exposure.\n\nWhich of the following muscles is most likely responsible for her inability to fully close her eye, and through which foramen does its innervating nerve exit the skull?",
  "choices": [
    "Levator palpebrae superioris – Superior orbital fissure",
    "Orbicularis oculi – Stylomastoid foramen",
    "Orbicularis oculi – Foramen rotundum",
    "Levator palpebrae superioris – Optic canal",
    "Superior tarsal muscle – Inferior orbital fissure"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Orbicularis oculi – Stylomastoid foramen. This patient has Bell’s palsy, a lower motor neuron lesion affecting the facial nerve (CN VII), which controls the muscles of facial expression. The orbicularis oculi muscle is responsible for closing the eyelid and is innervated by the temporal and zygomatic branches of CN VII. The facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. Dysfunction of this muscle leads to inability to close the eye, predisposing the cornea to exposure keratitis. Levator palpebrae superioris (CN III) opens the eyelid. Foramen rotundum (V2) and optic canal (CN II) transmit sensory or visual nerves, not motor innervation to facial muscles. The superior tarsal muscle is sympathetically innervated and assists in eyelid elevation but not closure."

  "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with progressively worsening tremor and difficulty initiating movement. He reports that his hands 'shake at rest,' and his wife has noticed a decrease in his facial expressions and arm swing while walking. Neurological examination reveals a resting tremor in both hands, cogwheel rigidity in the upper limbs, bradykinesia, and a shuffling gait. A diagnosis is made, and a dopaminergic therapy is initiated. Which of the following changes in the basal ganglia circuitry best explains this patient's symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased activity of the subthalamic nucleus leading to excessive thalamic excitation",
    "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to reduced stimulation of the direct pathway",
    "Lesion of the caudate nucleus leading to disinhibition of movement via the indirect pathway",
    "Hyperactivity of the globus pallidus internus resulting in increased cortical stimulation",
    "Destruction of the putamen causing loss of inhibitory input to the thalamus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to reduced stimulation of the direct pathway. This patient has classic symptoms of Parkinson disease, which is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These neurons normally modulate the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia. The direct pathway facilitates movement via D1 receptors and the indirect pathway inhibits movement via D2 receptors. Loss of dopamine leads to decreased activity of the direct pathway and increased activity of the indirect pathway, resulting in bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Increased activity of the subthalamic nucleus leading to excessive thalamic excitation – Incorrect. The subthalamic nucleus excites the GPi, which inhibits the thalamus, reducing movement. Overactivity of the STN results in reduced, not increased, thalamic excitation. 3. Lesion of the caudate nucleus leading to disinhibition of movement via the indirect pathway – Incorrect. Caudate lesions are seen in Huntington disease, not Parkinson’s. In Huntington, there's loss of indirect pathway inhibition, leading to hyperkinetic movements. 4. Hyperactivity of the globus pallidus internus resulting in increased cortical stimulation – Incorrect. Hyperactive GPi inhibits the thalamus more, leading to decreased cortical stimulation and hypokinesia, not increased stimulation. 5. Destruction of the putamen causing loss of inhibitory input to the thalamus – Incorrect. Loss of the putamen reduces inhibition of the GPi, increasing GPi activity and thalamic inhibition. Thus, the hallmark of Parkinson disease is dopamine loss, leading to reduced facilitation of movement."

  "question": "A 74-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department due to sudden onset weakness in his left leg. His family reports that he was eating breakfast when he suddenly dropped his spoon and could not stand up. On examination, he has 0/5 strength in the left lower extremity, diminished pinprick sensation over the left foot and leg, and preserved upper extremity strength and facial motor function. He is alert and oriented. Which of the following arteries is most likely occluded in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Middle cerebral artery",
    "Anterior cerebral artery",
    "Posterior cerebral artery",
    "Anterior choroidal artery",
    "Lenticulostriate arteries"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Anterior cerebral artery. This patient presents with isolated weakness and sensory loss in the contralateral lower extremity, which is a hallmark of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke. The ACA supplies the medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, which include the motor and sensory cortices controlling the lower limb. The patient's preserved facial and upper limb function supports a lesion confined to the ACA territory. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Middle cerebral artery – Incorrect. MCA strokes typically affect the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres, leading to contralateral face and upper extremity weakness and sensory loss, along with possible aphasia if the dominant hemisphere is involved. This pattern does not match the patient’s presentation. 3. Posterior cerebral artery – Incorrect. PCA strokes usually result in contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to occipital lobe involvement. Visual deficits are not seen in this patient. 4. Anterior choroidal artery – Incorrect. This artery supplies deep structures such as the posterior limb of the internal capsule, optic tract, and parts of the basal ganglia. Occlusion can cause hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and homonymous hemianopia, which is more extensive than this patient’s focal lower extremity findings. 5. Lenticulostriate arteries – Incorrect. These small penetrating branches of the MCA supply deep brain structures like the basal ganglia and internal capsule. Infarcts here cause pure motor or sensorimotor strokes affecting the face, arm, and leg equally, not just the leg."

  "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of worsening headache, fever, and swelling around her right eye. She also reports diplopia and difficulty moving the eye. Her symptoms started after she manipulated a large pimple on the bridge of her nose. On physical examination, she is febrile and has right-sided periorbital edema, proptosis, and ptosis. Extraocular movements of the right eye are limited in all directions. Her visual acuity is intact, but she has decreased sensation over the right upper cheek and forehead. Which of the following best explains the involvement of multiple cranial nerves in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Infection spread to the pterygopalatine fossa via the maxillary nerve",
    "Compression of the optic chiasm by an expanding sellar mass",
    "Thrombosis of a dural venous sinus containing multiple cranial nerves",
    "Direct extension of infection into the subarachnoid space",
    "Ischemic infarction of the internal capsule due to septic emboli"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Thrombosis of a dural venous sinus containing multiple cranial nerves. This patient has classic findings of cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST), a rare but life-threatening complication of facial infections, especially from the 'danger triangle' of the face. Infections can spread via the angular and ophthalmic veins into the cavernous sinus, a dural venous sinus located on either side of the sella turcica. The cavernous sinus contains cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI, along with the internal carotid artery. CST presents with headache, fever, periorbital edema, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia (due to involvement of CN III, IV, and VI), and sensory loss in the V1/V2 dermatomes. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Infection spread to the pterygopalatine fossa via the maxillary nerve – Incorrect. This pathway does not account for the widespread cranial nerve deficits or the severe systemic symptoms seen in CST. 2. Compression of the optic chiasm by an expanding sellar mass – Incorrect. This would cause bitemporal hemianopia and possibly hormonal abnormalities due to pituitary involvement, not ophthalmoplegia or facial swelling. 4. Direct extension of infection into the subarachnoid space – Incorrect. This would result in meningitis, presenting with neck stiffness, photophobia, and altered mental status, not cranial nerve palsies. 5. Ischemic infarction of the internal capsule due to septic emboli – Incorrect. This would cause contralateral motor and sensory deficits affecting the face, arm, and leg, not isolated cranial nerve dysfunction. The key distinguishing feature in CST is the involvement of multiple cranial nerves within a single venous structure."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to the neurology clinic due to progressive imbalance and numbness in his legs. He reports that he has difficulty walking in the dark or on uneven surfaces. Neurologic examination reveals a wide-based gait and a positive Romberg sign. Vibration and joint position sense are diminished in both lower extremities, while pinprick and temperature sensation are preserved. Muscle strength and reflexes are normal. Which of the following best explains the patient's deficits?",
  "choices": [
    "Degeneration of lateral corticospinal tracts causing motor dysfunction",
    "Damage to the anterior horns resulting in lower motor neuron signs",
    "Selective involvement of spinothalamic tracts impairing pain and temperature sensation",
    "Lesion of the posterior columns impairing proprioception and vibration sense",
    "Compression of the cauda equina causing bilateral lower limb radiculopathy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lesion of the posterior columns impairing proprioception and vibration sense. The posterior column–medial lemniscal (PCML) pathway transmits fine touch, vibration, and proprioception. Lesions in the posterior columns (especially in the spinal cord) result in sensory ataxia, positive Romberg sign, and loss of vibration and position sense. This patient’s preserved pain and temperature sensation suggests intact spinothalamic tracts, while the normal strength and reflexes rule out motor pathway involvement. These findings are classic for posterior column dysfunction, which can occur in conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, and multiple sclerosis. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Degeneration of lateral corticospinal tracts causing motor dysfunction – Incorrect. This would lead to upper motor neuron signs such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and weakness, none of which are present here. 2. Damage to the anterior horns resulting in lower motor neuron signs – Incorrect. Anterior horn involvement causes flaccid paralysis, atrophy, and fasciculations, not sensory deficits. 3. Selective involvement of spinothalamic tracts impairing pain and temperature sensation – Incorrect. Spinothalamic tract lesions would cause loss of pain and temperature, which this patient retains. 5. Compression of the cauda equina causing bilateral lower limb radiculopathy – Incorrect. Cauda equina syndrome causes asymmetric lower limb weakness, radicular pain, saddle anesthesia, and bladder/bowel dysfunction, not selective proprioceptive loss."

  "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset dizziness, nausea, and unsteady gait. On neurologic examination, he has right-sided limb ataxia, intention tremor, and a tendency to fall to the right. Cranial nerve examination reveals horizontal nystagmus and mild dysarthria. Motor strength and sensation are intact. A non-contrast CT head is unremarkable, but MRI reveals a small infarct in the cerebellum. The neurologic deficits are most consistent with involvement of which of the following structures?",
  "choices": [
    "Left superior cerebellar peduncle",
    "Right inferior cerebellar peduncle",
    "Right middle cerebellar peduncle",
    "Left inferior cerebellar peduncle",
    "Decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Right inferior cerebellar peduncle. The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) carries afferent fibers from the spinal cord (via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract), vestibular nuclei, and medulla to the cerebellum. It plays a crucial role in coordinating balance and proprioception. Lesions of the ICP cause ipsilateral cerebellar signs, including ataxia, intention tremor, and dysmetria. This patient's right-sided ataxia and fall tendency indicate a lesion on the right ICP. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Left superior cerebellar peduncle – Incorrect. The superior cerebellar peduncle contains primarily efferent fibers from the cerebellum to the midbrain and thalamus. It decussates in the midbrain and affects contralateral motor planning. A lesion here would typically cause contralateral findings. 3. Right middle cerebellar peduncle – Incorrect. The middle cerebellar peduncle carries pontocerebellar fibers from the contralateral cerebral cortex via the pons. A lesion here could cause ipsilateral cerebellar signs, but the middle cerebellar peduncle is less involved in vestibular processing compared to the ICP. 4. Left inferior cerebellar peduncle – Incorrect. A lesion here would produce left-sided cerebellar signs. The patient has right-sided symptoms. 5. Decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles – Incorrect. This occurs in the midbrain and involves bilateral coordination of motor output. Lesions here can be complex but would not explain isolated ipsilateral ataxia without other midbrain signs."

  "question": "A 4-week-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician due to increasing head circumference and bulging fontanelles. His parents report poor feeding and episodes of vomiting. On examination, the infant has macrocephaly, a downward gaze ('sunsetting' eyes), and increased tone in the lower extremities. Cranial ultrasound shows dilation of both lateral ventricles and the third ventricle, with a normal-sized fourth ventricle. Which of the following is the most likely site of obstruction in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Foramen of Monro",
    "Cerebral aqueduct",
    "Foramina of Luschka and Magendie",
    "Central canal of the spinal cord",
    "Subarachnoid granulations"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Cerebral aqueduct. This infant has non-communicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus, evidenced by enlarged lateral and third ventricles with a normal fourth ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) connects the third and fourth ventricles and is a common site of obstruction, especially in congenital aqueductal stenosis. This leads to CSF accumulation proximal to the blockage, causing the observed ventricular dilation and increased intracranial pressure. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Foramen of Monro – Incorrect. This foramen connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle. Obstruction here would cause unilateral or asymmetric lateral ventricle enlargement but typically spares the third ventricle. 3. Foramina of Luschka and Magendie – Incorrect. These drain the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space. Obstruction here would enlarge all ventricles, including the fourth, which is not seen here. 4. Central canal of the spinal cord – Incorrect. This plays a minor role in CSF circulation and its obstruction does not typically cause hydrocephalus. 5. Subarachnoid granulations – Incorrect. These structures absorb CSF into the venous system. Dysfunction here leads to communicating hydrocephalus with uniform ventricular enlargement, including the fourth ventricle."

  "question": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a sudden collapse at home. He takes warfarin for atrial fibrillation. On arrival, he is somnolent and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9. His pupils are reactive and symmetric, and he has left-sided hemiparesis. Vitals are stable. The emergency physician suspects an acute intracranial hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Non-contrast CT of the head",
    "Contrast-enhanced CT of the head",
    "MRI of the brain with gadolinium",
    "CT angiography of the head and neck",
    "PET scan of the brain"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Non-contrast CT of the head. In the setting of acute neurologic decline and suspected intracranial hemorrhage, a non-contrast CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. It is fast, widely available, and highly sensitive for detecting acute blood, which appears hyperdense. Contrast is avoided initially because it can obscure acute blood and complicate interpretation. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Contrast-enhanced CT of the head – Incorrect. Contrast is unnecessary and potentially harmful in acute hemorrhage, as it can mask or mimic blood and delay diagnosis. It is used later for tumor evaluation or infections. 2. MRI of the brain with gadolinium – Incorrect. While MRI provides excellent soft tissue detail, it is time-consuming and less practical in emergent settings. It is better for subacute or chronic processes, not for ruling out acute bleeds. 3. CT angiography of the head and neck – Incorrect. This is useful in evaluating vascular malformations, aneurysms, or large-vessel occlusions, but it is not the first step when acute hemorrhage is suspected. 4. PET scan of the brain – Incorrect. PET scans assess brain metabolism and are used in oncology or dementia workup, not for acute events like hemorrhage."

  "question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being struck in the head during a football game. He briefly lost consciousness, then regained full alertness, but now becomes increasingly drowsy and confused. Examination reveals anisocoria with a dilated right pupil and left-sided weakness. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is performed and shows a lens-shaped hyperdensity between the skull and the brain. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical findings?",
  "choices": [
    "Rupture of bridging veins",
    "Laceration of the middle meningeal artery",
    "Occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery",
    "Tearing of cortical arteries in the subarachnoid space",
    "Blockage of arachnoid granulations"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Laceration of the middle meningeal artery. Epidural hematomas are most commonly due to traumatic rupture of the middle meningeal artery, often associated with temporal bone fractures. The classic presentation includes a lucid interval followed by rapid neurological deterioration due to arterial bleeding. CT imaging shows a biconvex (lens-shaped) hematoma that does not cross suture lines. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Rupture of bridging veins – Incorrect. This causes subdural hematomas, which appear crescent-shaped and are more common in elderly or alcoholics after minor trauma. 2. Occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery – Incorrect. This would result in contralateral homonymous hemianopia, not acute hematoma or herniation signs. 3. Tearing of cortical arteries in the subarachnoid space – Incorrect. This would lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage, typically presenting with sudden thunderclap headache. 4. Blockage of arachnoid granulations – Incorrect. This leads to communicating hydrocephalus, not acute hemorrhage."

  "question": "A 70-year-old woman is evaluated for progressive gait instability and urinary incontinence over the past several months. Her family also reports that she has become increasingly forgetful and apathetic. On examination, she has a magnetic gait and is oriented to person only. MRI of the brain reveals enlarged ventricles without sulcal effacement. Which of the following best explains this patient's condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct",
    "Arnold-Chiari malformation",
    "Overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid by the choroid plexus",
    "Fibrosis of arachnoid granulations impairing CSF resorption",
    "Cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Fibrosis of arachnoid granulations impairing CSF resorption. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is not obstructed, but absorption is impaired, most commonly due to scarring or fibrosis of the arachnoid villi, often following meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or age-related changes. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a subtype presenting with the classic triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia. Imaging shows ventriculomegaly with normal or mildly elevated intracranial pressure. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct – Incorrect. This leads to non-communicating hydrocephalus with enlarged lateral and third ventricles but a normal fourth ventricle. 2. Arnold-Chiari malformation – Incorrect. This causes tonsillar herniation and can obstruct CSF outflow, leading to non-communicating hydrocephalus in children. 3. Overproduction of CSF by the choroid plexus – Incorrect. Rare cause of hydrocephalus, typically due to choroid plexus papilloma, and not associated with NPH features. 4. Cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle – Incorrect. This may indicate Dandy-Walker malformation and causes non-communicating hydrocephalus, especially in infants."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man is undergoing physical therapy after a lower extremity injury. During a stretching session, the therapist applies a sustained force to the patient's hamstring muscle. The muscle initially resists but then gradually relaxes. This phenomenon is attributed to autogenic inhibition, a reflex mediated by which of the following sensory receptors?",
  "choices": [
    "Muscle spindle",
    "Pacinian corpuscle",
    "Free nerve ending",
    "Golgi tendon organ",
    "Ruffini ending"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Golgi tendon organ. Autogenic inhibition is a protective spinal reflex that reduces muscle tension when a muscle is subjected to excessive force. It is mediated by Golgi tendon organs (GTOs), which are proprioceptive sensory receptors located at the junction of muscle and tendon. When tension increases, GTOs send afferent signals via group Ib fibers to the spinal cord, where inhibitory interneurons reduce alpha motor neuron activity, leading to muscle relaxation. This mechanism prevents tendon damage from excessive contraction. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Muscle spindle – Incorrect. Muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length and are responsible for the stretch (myotatic) reflex, which causes contraction in response to stretch. This is the opposite of autogenic inhibition. 2. Pacinian corpuscle – Incorrect. These mechanoreceptors are located in the skin and deep tissues and respond to vibration and pressure, not involved in reflex control. 3. Free nerve ending – Incorrect. These are unencapsulated nerve endings that mediate pain and temperature, not proprioceptive reflexes. 5. Ruffini ending – Incorrect. These slowly adapting mechanoreceptors are found in the skin and joint capsules and detect stretch and pressure but are not involved in autogenic inhibition."

  "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a motorcycle accident in which he was thrown from his bike and landed on his right shoulder with his head forcefully bent to the opposite side. On examination, his right upper limb is adducted and internally rotated at the shoulder, extended at the elbow, and pronated at the forearm. He is unable to abduct or externally rotate the shoulder or flex the elbow. Sensation is decreased over the lateral shoulder and upper arm. Which part of the brachial plexus is most likely injured?",
  "choices": [
    "Upper trunk",
    "Middle trunk",
    "Lower trunk",
    "Lateral cord",
    "Posterior cord"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Upper trunk. This patient's posture and motor deficits are characteristic of Erb-Duchenne palsy, which results from injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5-C6). The mechanism of injury typically involves excessive separation of the head and shoulder, as seen in motorcycle accidents or birth trauma. The upper trunk gives rise to the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves, which innervate the deltoid, infraspinatus, biceps brachii, and other muscles responsible for shoulder abduction, external rotation, and elbow flexion. The resulting 'waiter's tip' posture reflects paralysis of these muscles. Sensory loss over the lateral arm is due to involvement of the axillary nerve (C5). Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Middle trunk – Incorrect. The middle trunk arises from C7 and contributes to the radial nerve. Isolated injury here would primarily affect wrist and finger extension, not shoulder or elbow movement. 2. Lower trunk – Incorrect. Lower trunk (C8-T1) injuries lead to Klumpke palsy, affecting intrinsic hand muscles and leading to a claw hand deformity, not the waiter's tip posture. 3. Lateral cord – Incorrect. While it gives rise to the musculocutaneous nerve, injury here would not explain loss of shoulder abduction or external rotation, which involve more proximal structures. 4. Posterior cord – Incorrect. This gives rise to the axillary and radial nerves, but isolated injury here would more likely involve deltoid and triceps weakness without the full Erb’s palsy pattern."

  "question": "A 60-year-old man is found unresponsive on the floor by his family and is brought to the emergency department. On arrival, his eyes open only to painful stimuli. He moans incomprehensibly but makes no discernible words. When stimulated, he extends both arms and legs. Which of the following is this patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score?",
  "choices": [
    "6",
    "7",
    "8",
    "9",
    "10"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: 7. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assesses a patient's level of consciousness based on eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. Each category has a set of possible scores: Eye Opening (E): 2 – to pain. Verbal Response (V): 2 – incomprehensible sounds. Motor Response (M): 3 – extension to pain (decerebrate posturing). Adding these gives a total GCS score of 2 (E) + 2 (V) + 3 (M) = 7. This score indicates a severe head injury and poor neurologic function. Incorrect answer explanations: 6 – Incorrect. This would require a motor response of 2 (no movement) or another lower category score. 8 – Incorrect. This would require a slightly better verbal or motor response. 9 or 10 – Incorrect. These would suggest higher levels of responsiveness, such as obeying commands or producing coherent speech, which this patient does not demonstrate."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with slowness of movement, resting tremor, and muscle rigidity. His neurologist suspects Parkinson disease. Further evaluation reveals degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that normally facilitate movement through the basal ganglia circuitry. Which of the following best describes the effect of dopamine on the direct and indirect pathways in the basal ganglia?",
  "choices": [
    "Inhibits both direct and indirect pathways",
    "Stimulates both direct and indirect pathways",
    "Stimulates the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway",
    "Inhibits the direct pathway and stimulates the indirect pathway",
    "Has no effect on basal ganglia output"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Stimulates the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway. Dopamine, released by neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, modulates the activity of the basal ganglia through D1 and D2 receptors. It stimulates the direct pathway via D1 receptors, which facilitates movement, and inhibits the indirect pathway via D2 receptors, which normally suppresses movement. The net effect of dopamine is to promote movement. In Parkinson disease, the loss of dopaminergic input results in reduced activity of the direct pathway and increased activity of the indirect pathway, leading to bradykinesia and rigidity. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Inhibits both direct and indirect pathways – Incorrect. This would reduce all output but does not reflect dopamine’s differential effects on the pathways. 2. Stimulates both direct and indirect pathways – Incorrect. Dopamine has opposing effects: it stimulates the direct and inhibits the indirect pathway. 3. Inhibits the direct pathway and stimulates the indirect pathway – Incorrect. This pattern occurs in Parkinson disease due to loss of dopamine, not due to dopamine’s direct action. 4. Has no effect on basal ganglia output – Incorrect. Dopamine is critical for modulating basal ganglia output; its absence leads to severe motor impairment."

  "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents with a 1-week history of worsening headache, nausea, and blurred vision. She recently began oral contraceptives. Neurological exam reveals bilateral papilledema, but no focal deficits. MRI of the brain with venography shows thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the structure involved in this patient’s condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Drains cerebrospinal fluid via arachnoid granulations into the dural venous system",
    "Transfers venous blood from the cavernous sinus to the internal jugular vein",
    "Carries arterial blood to the superficial cortex of the cerebral hemispheres",
    "Provides a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid to flow from the lateral to the third ventricle",
    "Facilitates reabsorption of interstitial fluid into deep cervical lymphatics"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Drains cerebrospinal fluid via arachnoid granulations into the dural venous system. The superior sagittal sinus is a dural venous sinus that runs along the midline of the skull, overlying the falx cerebri. It collects blood from cerebral veins and reabsorbs cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space via arachnoid granulations. Thrombosis of this sinus can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to headache, papilledema, and vision changes. Oral contraceptive use is a known risk factor due to increased coagulability. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Transfers venous blood from the cavernous sinus to the internal jugular vein – Incorrect. This describes the inferior petrosal sinus, not the superior sagittal sinus. 2. Carries arterial blood to the superficial cortex of the cerebral hemispheres – Incorrect. This describes branches of the middle cerebral artery, not a venous sinus. 3. Provides a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid to flow from the lateral to the third ventricle – Incorrect. This is the function of the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro), not the superior sagittal sinus. 4. Facilitates reabsorption of interstitial fluid into deep cervical lymphatics – Incorrect. This describes part of the lymphatic drainage system, not a function of the superior sagittal sinus."

His wife notes that he has become quieter, blinks less frequently, and has developed a shuffling gait. On neurologic examination, he demonstrates resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and decreased arm swing while walking. Which of the following neuroanatomical changes is most directly responsible for his condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Degeneration of neurons in the caudate nucleus",
    "Atrophy of the subthalamic nucleus",
    "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta",
    "Lesion of the internal capsule affecting corticospinal tracts",
    "Demyelination of corticobulbar tracts in the brainstem"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to reduced dopamine input to the striatum. This disrupts the normal balance of the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, resulting in bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Degeneration of neurons in the caudate nucleus – Incorrect. This is associated with Huntington disease, a hyperkinetic disorder. 2. Atrophy of the subthalamic nucleus – Incorrect. This leads to hemiballismus, a hyperkinetic movement disorder. 4. Lesion of the internal capsule – Incorrect. This would cause contralateral motor deficits but is not the pathophysiologic basis of Parkinson’s. 5. Demyelination of corticobulbar tracts – Incorrect. This is more consistent with ALS or other demyelinating diseases, not Parkinson's."

  "question": "A 70-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset involuntary flinging movements of her left arm and leg. The movements are continuous, violent, and worsen with voluntary motion. Neurologic examination reveals no weakness or sensory loss. MRI of the brain reveals a small infarct in the subthalamic region on the right. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of her symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus internus",
    "Decreased inhibitory output from the globus pallidus externus to the subthalamic nucleus",
    "Loss of excitatory input from the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus internus",
    "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra",
    "Lesion of the caudate nucleus resulting in disinhibition of the motor cortex"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Loss of excitatory input from the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus internus. Hemiballismus is caused by a lesion (usually vascular) of the subthalamic nucleus, which normally excites the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Loss of this excitatory input reduces GPi activity, resulting in less inhibition of the thalamus and excessive movement. The hallmark is unilateral, violent, flinging movements on the side contralateral to the lesion. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Increased excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus – Incorrect. This would enhance GPi inhibition of the thalamus and suppress movement. 2. Decreased inhibitory output from the globus pallidus externus – Incorrect. This describes part of the indirect pathway, but the key lesion in hemiballismus is loss of subthalamic output. 4. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra – Incorrect. This is seen in Parkinson’s disease, not hemiballismus. 5. Lesion of the caudate nucleus – Incorrect. This is more characteristic of Huntington disease, leading to chorea, not hemiballismus."

  "question": "A 38-year-old man presents to the clinic with progressive mood changes, memory problems, and involuntary movements. His wife reports that he has become irritable and forgetful over the past year and has started making random jerking movements of his arms. On examination, he has choreiform movements and impaired attention. MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the caudate nuclei bilaterally. Genetic testing is performed. Which of the following best describes the underlying mechanism of this patient’s condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Autosomal recessive mutation causing lysosomal enzyme deficiency",
    "X-linked trinucleotide repeat expansion leading to defective DNA repair",
    "Autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat expansion leading to neuronal degeneration",
    "Loss-of-function mutation in the parkin gene affecting mitochondrial turnover",
    "Deletion of the gene encoding dystrophin in the cerebral cortex"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat expansion leading to neuronal degeneration. Huntington disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This leads to toxic gain-of-function in the huntingtin protein and preferential degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the caudate and putamen. Clinical features include chorea, psychiatric symptoms (depression, irritability), and cognitive decline. Imaging shows caudate atrophy with enlargement of the lateral ventricles. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Autosomal recessive mutation causing lysosomal enzyme deficiency – Incorrect. This describes disorders like Tay-Sachs or Gaucher disease, not Huntington. 2. X-linked trinucleotide repeat expansion – Incorrect. This describes Fragile X syndrome, not Huntington, which is autosomal dominant. 4. Loss-of-function mutation in the parkin gene – Incorrect. This is associated with juvenile Parkinson disease, not chorea or caudate atrophy. 5. Deletion of the gene encoding dystrophin – Incorrect. This is seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, not neurodegenerative diseases."

She frequently misplaces items, repeats questions, and has difficulty managing finances. Her Mini-Mental State Examination score is 21/30. MRI of the brain shows diffuse cortical atrophy, especially in the hippocampus and temporal lobes. Postmortem brain biopsy would most likely show accumulation of which of the following pathological features responsible for neuronal toxicity in this disease?",
  "choices": [
    "Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein",
    "Neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau",
    "Globoid cells due to galactocerebrosidase deficiency",
    "Inclusions of mutant huntingtin protein in the caudate",
    "Demyelinated plaques with perivenular lymphocytic infiltrates"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by two major histopathologic features: extracellular beta-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These tau tangles are strongly associated with neuronal dysfunction and correlate with disease severity. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable, leading to early memory impairment. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein – Incorrect. These are seen in Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, not in classical Alzheimer’s disease. 3. Globoid cells due to galactocerebrosidase deficiency – Incorrect. This is characteristic of Krabbe disease, a leukodystrophy. 4. Inclusions of mutant huntingtin protein – Incorrect. These are seen in Huntington disease, which presents with chorea and psychiatric decline. 5. Demyelinated plaques with perivenular lymphocytes – Incorrect. This describes multiple sclerosis, which is a demyelinating autoimmune disease, not a neurodegenerative dementia."

  "question": "A 62-year-old man suffers a stroke that results in profound anterograde amnesia. He cannot form new declarative memories and frequently forgets recent conversations and events. However, over time, he is able to learn a new motor skill involving a complex sequence of button presses, despite having no recollection of being trained on the task. This preserved ability is best explained by the integrity of which type of memory system?",
  "choices": [
    "Working memory",
    "Episodic memory",
    "Semantic memory",
    "Implicit (procedural) memory",
    "Short-term sensory memory"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Implicit (procedural) memory. Implicit memory refers to unconscious memory processes such as skills, habits, and conditioned responses. Procedural memory, a subtype of implicit memory, allows for learning of motor tasks and routines (e.g., riding a bike, typing) without conscious awareness. It is mediated by the basal ganglia and cerebellum and is often preserved in patients with medial temporal lobe damage, including the hippocampus. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Working memory – Incorrect. This involves temporarily holding and manipulating information, largely dependent on the prefrontal cortex. It does not explain long-term motor learning. 2. Episodic memory – Incorrect. This refers to recollection of specific personal experiences and events, which is impaired in this patient. 3. Semantic memory – Incorrect. This involves factual knowledge and concepts; while it may be impaired in amnesia, it is not responsible for motor learning. 5. Short-term sensory memory – Incorrect. This includes fleeting impressions from the senses (iconic, echoic memory) and does not underlie procedural learning."

  "question": "A 70-year-old man with a 5-year history of Parkinson disease presents for follow-up. He was initially treated with levodopa-carbidopa and experienced significant improvement in his motor symptoms. However, over the past few months, he has developed intermittent episodes of bradykinesia alternating with periods of involuntary, dance-like movements. These symptoms fluctuate throughout the day, often related to timing of his medication doses. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's new symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Development of tolerance to levodopa in the periphery",
    "Decreased ability of carbidopa to cross the blood-brain barrier",
    "Pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors due to short half-life of levodopa",
    "Upregulation of muscarinic receptors in the basal ganglia",
    "Inhibition of monoamine oxidase B by carbidopa"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors due to short half-life of levodopa. Levodopa is a dopamine precursor that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the CNS. Carbidopa prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa, increasing its central availability. Over time, patients can develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesias due to the short half-life of levodopa and the resulting intermittent, non-physiologic stimulation of dopamine receptors. This leads to periods of 'on' (dyskinesia) and 'off' (bradykinesia) symptoms. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Development of tolerance to levodopa in the periphery – Incorrect. Tolerance is not a major issue, and peripheral tolerance would not explain central motor fluctuations. 2. Decreased ability of carbidopa to cross the blood-brain barrier – Incorrect. Carbidopa does not need to enter the brain; it works peripherally to block dopa decarboxylase. 4. Upregulation of muscarinic receptors – Incorrect. Parkinson disease and its treatment are primarily dopaminergic, not cholinergic in this context. 5. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase B by carbidopa – Incorrect. Carbidopa does not inhibit MAO-B; that is the role of drugs like selegiline or rasagiline."

  "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to the neurology clinic with intermittent occipital headaches that worsen with coughing, sneezing, or straining. She also reports episodes of dizziness, unsteady gait, and tingling in both hands. Neurological exam reveals mild ataxia and decreased pain and temperature sensation in the upper extremities bilaterally. MRI of the brain and cervical spine shows herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, with an associated syrinx in the cervical spinal cord. Which of the following best explains this patient’s condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Congenital downward displacement of cerebellar tonsils causing compression of medullary structures",
    "Acquired arachnoid scarring leading to obstruction of CSF at the cerebral aqueduct",
    "Failure of closure of the vertebral arches leading to exposed neural tissue",
    "Overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid by a choroid plexus papilloma",
    "Congenital agenesis of the cerebellar vermis leading to cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Congenital downward displacement of cerebellar tonsils causing compression of medullary structures. Chiari I malformation is characterized by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. It is often asymptomatic until adolescence or adulthood and may present with occipital headaches worsened by Valsalva maneuvers, cerebellar signs (ataxia, dizziness), and syringomyelia, which causes bilateral loss of pain and temperature in a 'cape-like' distribution. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Acquired arachnoid scarring – Incorrect. This may lead to communicating hydrocephalus but does not cause tonsillar herniation or syringomyelia. 2. Failure of closure of the vertebral arches – Incorrect. This describes spina bifida, a neural tube defect, not Chiari I malformation. 3. Overproduction of CSF – Incorrect. This is rare and typically caused by choroid plexus papillomas, which lead to hydrocephalus, not posterior fossa herniation. 4. Congenital agenesis of the cerebellar vermis – Incorrect. This is seen in Dandy-Walker malformation, which features cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus, not isolated tonsillar herniation."

  "question": "A 58-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his wife due to personality changes over the past year. She reports that he has become socially inappropriate, apathetic, and emotionally blunted. He makes rude comments in public and shows little concern for others. His memory is relatively intact, but he has difficulty with planning and problem-solving. Neurological examination is normal. MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Alzheimer disease",
    "Frontotemporal dementia",
    "Lewy body dementia",
    "Vascular dementia",
    "Normal pressure hydrocephalus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Frontotemporal dementia. FTD typically presents before age 65 and is characterized by prominent changes in personality, behavior, and executive functioning. Memory is often relatively preserved early in the disease. MRI shows atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Pathologically, FTD can be associated with tau or TDP-43 protein inclusions. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Alzheimer disease – Incorrect. Alzheimer’s typically begins with memory loss and later progresses to global cognitive decline. Personality changes occur later and are not the initial presentation. 3. Lewy body dementia – Incorrect. This presents with visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuating cognition. Behavioral disinhibition is not a hallmark. 4. Vascular dementia – Incorrect. This shows a stepwise decline and focal neurologic signs due to multiple infarcts, not primarily behavioral changes. 5. Normal pressure hydrocephalus – Incorrect. This presents with the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, but behavioral disinhibition is not a key feature."

He was last seen normal 45 minutes ago. On examination, he has right hemiparesis, right facial droop, and expressive aphasia. Non-contrast CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
  "choices": [
    "Start aspirin and observe",
    "Administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)",
    "Perform carotid endarterectomy",
    "Begin dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel",
    "Start high-dose corticosteroids"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This patient has an acute ischemic stroke presenting within the 4.5-hour window and has no contraindications to thrombolysis. IV tPA (alteplase) is the standard of care for eligible patients. Imaging must first rule out hemorrhage. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Start aspirin and observe – Incorrect. Aspirin is appropriate for ischemic stroke, but it should be delayed for 24 hours after tPA. 3. Perform carotid endarterectomy – Incorrect. This is used for symptomatic carotid stenosis but not in the acute stroke setting. 4. Begin dual antiplatelet therapy – Incorrect. Dual therapy may be used for minor strokes or TIA but not in place of tPA in a major stroke. 5. Start high-dose corticosteroids – Incorrect. These are not used in ischemic stroke and have no proven benefit."

  "question": "A 61-year-old man with long-standing hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents with sudden-onset left-sided weakness. He has no visual deficits, aphasia, or sensory loss. Neurological exam shows left-sided hemiparesis affecting the face, arm, and leg equally, without cortical signs. CT scan shows a small infarct in the posterior limb of the right internal capsule. Which of the following best describes the underlying mechanism of this stroke?",
  "choices": [
    "Thromboembolism from carotid artery plaque",
    "Cardioembolic infarction from atrial fibrillation",
    "Lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries",
    "Rupture of a berry aneurysm",
    "Amyloid angiopathy with vessel wall weakening"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries. Lacunar strokes affect deep brain structures such as the internal capsule, thalamus, or basal ganglia and are caused by small vessel disease due to chronic hypertension or diabetes. Lipohyalinosis and microatheroma formation are key mechanisms. These strokes often produce pure motor or pure sensory syndromes without cortical findings. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Thromboembolism from carotid plaque – Incorrect. This would more likely affect cortical territories (e.g., MCA) and cause aphasia or neglect. 2. Cardioembolic infarction – Incorrect. This causes larger, often cortical strokes with sudden maximal symptoms and is less likely in this pure motor case. 4. Rupture of a berry aneurysm – Incorrect. This leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage, not an ischemic lacunar stroke. 5. Amyloid angiopathy – Incorrect. This causes lobar hemorrhages in the elderly, not lacunar infarcts."

  "question": "A 70-year-old man presents to the emergency department after suddenly noticing that he cannot see anything on the left side of his visual field. He denies weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. On neurological exam, he has a left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing. Motor, sensory, and language functions are intact. Which of the following cerebral arteries is most likely affected?",
  "choices": [
    "Left anterior cerebral artery",
    "Right middle cerebral artery",
    "Right posterior cerebral artery",
    "Left posterior communicating artery",
    "Basilar artery"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Right posterior cerebral artery. A PCA infarct most commonly affects the occipital lobe, which contains the primary visual cortex. Damage to the right visual cortex leads to a left homonymous hemianopia. Macular sparing occurs because the macular region has dual blood supply from both the PCA and MCA. This patient's intact motor, sensory, and language function further localizes the stroke to the occipital lobe rather than frontal, parietal, or temporal areas. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Left anterior cerebral artery – Incorrect. ACA strokes typically affect the medial frontal lobe and cause contralateral leg weakness, not visual field defects. 2. Right middle cerebral artery – Incorrect. MCA strokes affect the lateral cerebral hemisphere and commonly produce contralateral face and arm weakness, aphasia (dominant hemisphere), or neglect (non-dominant hemisphere). 4. Left posterior communicating artery – Incorrect. While this artery connects the posterior and anterior circulations, isolated infarcts here are uncommon and do not match the presentation. 5. Basilar artery – Incorrect. Occlusion leads to severe brainstem dysfunction and potentially 'locked-in syndrome,' not isolated visual loss."

Neurological examination is normal between episodes. MRI of the brain is ordered to evaluate for secondary causes. Which of the following best explains the most common underlying pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Autoimmune demyelination of cranial nerve V",
    "Microvascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root",
    "Degeneration of the trigeminal ganglion neurons",
    "Infiltration of the nerve by herpes zoster virus",
    "Central sensitization due to chronic inflammation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Microvascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root. The most common pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia is vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root at or near its entry zone into the pons. This compression, often by a looping artery such as the superior cerebellar artery, leads to focal demyelination and hyperexcitability of the nerve, resulting in the classic paroxysmal facial pain. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Autoimmune demyelination – Incorrect. This is more typical of multiple sclerosis, which can cause secondary trigeminal neuralgia, but it is not the most common mechanism. 2. Degeneration of trigeminal ganglion neurons – Incorrect. Neurodegeneration is not the key process; the issue is more related to nerve root demyelination from external compression. 3. Infiltration by herpes zoster – Incorrect. This would cause postherpetic neuralgia, typically with persistent burning pain and skin changes. 4. Central sensitization – Incorrect. This occurs in chronic pain conditions but does not explain the episodic, stimulus-triggered nature of trigeminal neuralgia."

  "question": "A 32-year-old man presents after being stabbed in the back during an altercation. On examination, he has weakness and loss of proprioception and vibration sense in his right leg, along with loss of pain and temperature sensation in his left leg below the level of the lesion. Which of the following best explains the neuroanatomic basis of this patient’s presentation?",
  "choices": [
    "Complete transection of the spinal cord at the level of injury",
    "Hemisection of the spinal cord with ipsilateral corticospinal and dorsal column disruption and contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement",
    "Isolated damage to the anterior horn cells on the right side",
    "Central cord syndrome affecting crossing spinothalamic fibers bilaterally",
    "Posterior cord syndrome involving bilateral dorsal columns"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Hemisection of the spinal cord with ipsilateral corticospinal and dorsal column disruption and contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement. Brown-Séquard syndrome results from hemisection of the spinal cord, commonly due to penetrating trauma. It produces a characteristic pattern: ipsilateral loss of motor function (corticospinal tract) and proprioception/vibration sense (dorsal columns), and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tract) starting a few levels below the lesion. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Complete transection – Incorrect. This would cause bilateral loss of motor and all sensory modalities below the lesion. 2. Isolated anterior horn damage – Incorrect. This would cause ipsilateral lower motor neuron signs only at the level of the lesion. 3. Central cord syndrome – Incorrect. This causes bilateral loss of pain and temperature in a cape-like distribution, often with upper extremity weakness. 4. Posterior cord syndrome – Incorrect. This causes bilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sense but does not explain the contralateral pain and temperature loss."

  "question": "A 59-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes presents with burning pain and tingling in his feet that worsens at night. He also reports episodes of lightheadedness when standing up and decreased awareness of bladder fullness. On examination, pinprick and temperature sensation are reduced in a stocking distribution, while vibration sense and proprioception are intact. Which of the following best characterizes the type of nerve fibers predominantly affected in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Large myelinated A-alpha fibers responsible for motor function",
    "Large myelinated A-beta fibers involved in vibration and proprioception",
    "Small unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated A-delta fibers mediating pain, temperature, and autonomic function",
    "Medium myelinated fibers transmitting light touch and joint position sense",
    "Sympathetic preganglionic B fibers responsible for reflexes"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Small unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated A-delta fibers mediating pain, temperature, and autonomic function. This patient has a small fiber peripheral neuropathy, commonly seen in diabetes. Small fibers transmit pain, temperature, and autonomic signals. Their dysfunction leads to burning or stabbing pain, thermal sensory loss, and autonomic symptoms like orthostatic hypotension and impaired bladder awareness. Vibration and proprioception, carried by large A-beta fibers, remain intact. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Large myelinated A-alpha fibers – Incorrect. These are motor fibers; damage would cause weakness or atrophy, not sensory deficits. 2. Large myelinated A-beta fibers – Incorrect. These carry vibration and proprioception, which are preserved in this patient. 4. Medium myelinated fibers – Incorrect. This category is vague and doesn't specifically account for the pattern of sensory loss seen here. 5. Sympathetic preganglionic B fibers – Incorrect.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Spongiform changes with neuronal loss and absence of inflammatory cells. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and spongiform degeneration on histology. The gray matter shows numerous vacuoles in the neuropil and neuronal loss without a significant inflammatory response. The disease is fatal, with death typically occurring within a year of symptom onset. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Lewy bodies – Incorrect. These are seen in Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and contain alpha-synuclein. 2. Perivascular lymphocytes with demyelination – Incorrect.

  "choices": [
    "Reversible inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels in the resting state",
    "Reversible blockade of potassium efflux through ligand-gated K+ channels",
    "Inhibition of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction",
    "Reversible inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels in the activated and inactivated states",
    "Competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors in sensory neurons"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Reversible inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels in the activated and inactivated states. Local anesthetics like lidocaine block voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing the initiation and propagation of action potentials in sensory nerves. They preferentially bind to sodium channels in the activated and inactivated states, making rapidly firing neurons (like pain fibers) more susceptible. This blockade inhibits depolarization, leading to loss of sensation. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Inhibition in the resting state – Incorrect. Resting channels have lower affinity for local anesthetics; blockade is use-dependent. 2. Blockade of K+ channels – Incorrect. Potassium channels are not the primary target of local anesthetics. 3. Inhibition of acetylcholine release – Incorrect. This is the mechanism of botulinum toxin, not lidocaine. 5. NMDA receptor antagonism – Incorrect. This is seen with agents like ketamine; local anesthetics do not target NMDA receptors."

    "Halothane",
    "Nitrous oxide",
    "Isoflurane",
    "Sevoflurane"

  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane is a commonly used volatile anesthetic, particularly in pediatric patients. It has a low blood-gas partition coefficient, allowing for rapid onset and offset, and is non-irritating to the airway, making it ideal for inhalational induction. It also causes minimal airway resistance and cardiovascular depression. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Desflurane – Incorrect. Though it has a very low blood-gas solubility, it is pungent and can cause airway irritation, coughing, and laryngospasm. 2. Halothane – Incorrect. Halothane is no longer widely used due to its risk of hepatotoxicity and cardiac depression. 3. Nitrous oxide – Incorrect. It has excellent analgesic properties but is not potent enough for surgical anesthesia on its own. 4. Isoflurane – Incorrect. Isoflurane is more commonly used for maintenance and has a higher blood-gas coefficient, leading to slower induction."

  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Migraine with aura. Migraines are typically unilateral, pulsatile, and accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. The presence of a visual aura (e.g., flashing lights or scotomas) prior to the headache confirms the diagnosis of migraine with aura. These headaches can be disabling and often have identifiable triggers. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Tension-type headache – Incorrect. Tension headaches are bilateral, pressing or tightening in quality, and not associated with nausea or aura. 2. Cluster headache – Incorrect. Cluster headaches are unilateral but are brief, extremely painful, and associated with autonomic features like lacrimation and nasal congestion, usually in men. 3. Temporal arteritis – Incorrect.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Agonism at 5-HT1B/1D serotonin receptors leading to cranial vasoconstriction and inhibition of neuropeptide release. Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan) are selective serotonin receptor agonists that act on 5-HT1B receptors to cause vasoconstriction of dilated intracranial blood vessels and on 5-HT1D receptors to inhibit the release of CGRP and other neuropeptides from trigeminal nerve endings. These effects relieve migraine symptoms. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Nonselective COX inhibition – Incorrect. This describes NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), which can help with mild migraine but are not as effective as triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks. 2. Calcium channel blockade – Incorrect. This is the mechanism of some anticonvulsants used for prophylaxis (e.g., gabapentin), not acute treatment. 4. NMDA receptor antagonism – Incorrect. Seen with drugs like ketamine; not relevant to triptans. 5. H1 receptor blockade – Incorrect. Antihistamines are not first-line agents for migraine relief."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man is given intravenous morphine in the emergency department for acute abdominal pain. Shortly after administration, he reports pain relief and appears sedated. Which of the following best describes the primary mechanism of action by which opioids like morphine alleviate pain?",
  "choices": [
    "Agonism at GABA-A receptors leading to chloride influx and neuronal hyperpolarization",
    "Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic terminals to reduce neurotransmitter release",
    "Activation of AMPA receptors to increase excitatory neurotransmission",
    "Inhibition of monoamine reuptake to increase serotonin and norepinephrine in the synapse",
    "Direct antagonism of NMDA receptors to reduce central sensitization"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic terminals to reduce neurotransmitter release. Opioids such as morphine are μ-opioid receptor agonists. These G-protein-coupled receptors act via Gi proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, open postsynaptic potassium channels (causing hyperpolarization), and close presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. The latter action reduces neurotransmitter release (e.g., glutamate, substance P), decreasing nociceptive signaling. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. GABA-A receptor agonism – Incorrect. This is the mechanism of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, not opioids. 2. AMPA receptor activation – Incorrect. This would increase excitatory transmission and pain, not relieve it. 3. Monoamine reuptake inhibition – Incorrect. This is seen in some antidepressants and tramadol, but not the primary action of classic opioids. 4. NMDA receptor antagonism – Incorrect. Some opioids (e.g., methadone) have NMDA activity, but this is not the primary mechanism for most opioids like morphine."

  "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. He reports sudden weakness in both legs and inability to feel pain or temperature below the level of his umbilicus. On examination, he has complete motor paralysis and loss of pinprick and temperature sensation below the T10 level, but light touch, vibration, and proprioception are preserved. Which of the following spinal cord structures is most likely affected in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Dorsal columns bilaterally",
    "Lateral corticospinal tracts and anterior horns",
    "Dorsal root ganglia",
    "Central canal and surrounding gray matter",
    "Posterior spinal arteries"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lateral corticospinal tracts and anterior horns. This patient has anterior cord syndrome, typically due to infarction of the anterior spinal artery. It results in bilateral motor paralysis (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts and anterior horns) and loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tracts), while dorsal column function (vibration and proprioception) is spared because it is supplied by the posterior spinal arteries. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Dorsal columns – Incorrect. These carry vibration and proprioception, which are preserved in anterior cord syndrome. 2. Dorsal root ganglia – Incorrect. These are sensory cell bodies outside the spinal cord and not the primary site of injury here. 3. Central canal and surrounding gray matter – Incorrect. This pattern is more consistent with syringomyelia, which causes cape-like loss of pain and temperature in the upper extremities. 4. Posterior spinal arteries – Incorrect. These supply the dorsal columns, not the anterior cord."

  "question": "A premature infant born at 27 weeks gestation is receiving supplemental oxygen in the neonatal intensive care unit. At 6 weeks of life, an ophthalmology screening reveals abnormal retinal vascular proliferation. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased intraocular pressure damaging the optic nerve",
    "Autoimmune destruction of photoreceptors",
    "Hyperoxia-induced downregulation of VEGF followed by hypoxia-triggered neovascularization",
    "Congenital infection disrupting retinal development",
    "Mutation in rhodopsin leading to retinal degeneration"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Hyperoxia-induced downregulation of VEGF followed by hypoxia-triggered neovascularization. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs in preterm infants exposed to high levels of supplemental oxygen. The initial hyperoxia suppresses VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), halting normal retinal vessel development. When the infant returns to room air, the relatively hypoxic retina stimulates a surge in VEGF, leading to pathologic neovascularization, which can cause retinal detachment and blindness. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Increased intraocular pressure – Incorrect. This describes glaucoma, not ROP. 2. Autoimmune destruction – Incorrect. Autoimmune retinopathies are rare and not seen in premature neonates. 3. Congenital infection – Incorrect. TORCH infections can affect the retina but do not follow this pattern of postnatal oxygen-related vascular dysregulation. 4. Rhodopsin mutation – Incorrect. This is seen in retinitis pigmentosa, not ROP."

  "question": "A 42-year-old man presents with progressive night blindness. Fundoscopic examination reveals retinal pigmentary changes consistent with retinitis pigmentosa. Which of the following retinal layers is primarily affected in this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Ganglion cell layer",
    "Photoreceptor layer (rods and cones)",
    "Inner nuclear layer",
    "Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)",
    "Inner plexiform layer"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Photoreceptor layer (rods and cones). In retinitis pigmentosa, the primary pathology involves degeneration of the photoreceptors, especially rods, which are responsible for vision in low-light conditions. This explains the early symptom of night blindness. As the disease progresses, cones may also be affected, leading to peripheral vision loss and eventual central vision impairment. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Ganglion cell layer – Incorrect. This layer transmits visual signals to the brain but is not the primary site of degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa. 2. Inner nuclear layer – Incorrect. Contains bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells, which are second-order neurons, not primarily affected in this condition. 3. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) – Incorrect. The RPE supports photoreceptors and may show secondary changes but is not the initiating site of degeneration. 4. Inner plexiform layer – Incorrect. This is a synaptic layer between bipolar and ganglion cells and is not primarily involved in photoreceptor degenerative disorders."

  "question": "A 60-year-old woman presents with difficulty seeing objects in the upper left portion of her visual field. Visual field testing reveals a left superior quadrantic anopia. She denies headache or eye pain. Neurological examination is otherwise normal. Which of the following is the most likely location of the lesion causing this patient’s visual deficit?",
  "choices": [
    "Right optic nerve",
    "Left lateral geniculate nucleus",
    "Right upper bank of the calcarine fissure",
    "Left Meyer's loop in the temporal lobe",
    "Right Meyer's loop in the temporal lobe"

  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Right Meyer's loop in the temporal lobe. Meyer's loop carries visual information from the inferior retina (superior visual field) and travels through the temporal lobe before reaching the primary visual cortex. A lesion in the right Meyer's loop causes a left superior quadrantic anopia ('pie in the sky' defect). Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Right optic nerve – Incorrect. This would cause right monocular vision loss, not a quadrantic visual field defect. 2. Left lateral geniculate nucleus – Incorrect. Lesions here can cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia but not a quadrant-specific loss. 3. Right upper bank of the calcarine fissure – Incorrect. This processes inferior visual field information and would result in a left inferior quadrantic anopia. 4. Left Meyer's loop – Incorrect. This would cause a right superior quadrantic anopia."

On examination, her right visual acuity is decreased, and when a light is swung from the left eye to the right eye, both pupils briefly dilate before constricting again. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this finding?",
  "choices": [
    "Efferent parasympathetic defect in the right oculomotor nerve",
    "Increased intracranial pressure causing bilateral papilledema",
    "Lesion in the pretectal area of the midbrain disrupting the pupillary light reflex",
    "Optic nerve demyelination causing impaired afferent input from the right eye",
    "Lesion of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus affecting pupillary constriction"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Optic nerve demyelination causing impaired afferent input from the right eye. A Marcus Gunn pupil (relative afferent pupillary defect, or RAPD) occurs when the affected eye has reduced afferent input, usually due to optic nerve damage, most commonly from optic neuritis associated with multiple sclerosis. When light is shone into the affected eye, the pupils constrict less than when light is shone into the unaffected eye — and may even appear to briefly dilate — due to decreased signal to the midbrain. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Efferent parasympathetic defect – Incorrect. This would cause a fixed dilated pupil but would not produce a relative afferent defect or swinging light test abnormality. 2. Papilledema – Incorrect. This may cause visual obscurations but typically does not cause a relative afferent defect unless asymmetric. 3. Pretectal area lesion – Incorrect. This would affect both eyes' pupillary light reflexes and cause more severe bilateral defects. 5. Edinger-Westphal lesion – Incorrect. This would result in an efferent pupillary defect (e.g., a dilated pupil that does not constrict) rather than an afferent defect."

  "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe right eye pain, blurred vision, headache, and nausea. She reports seeing halos around lights. On examination, her right eye is red with a mid-dilated, non-reactive pupil, and the cornea appears hazy. Intraocular pressure is significantly elevated. Which of the following best explains the underlying pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased aqueous humor production by the ciliary body",
    "Obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory debris",
    "Sudden blockage of aqueous outflow through the pupil leading to iris apposition to the trabecular meshwork",
    "Degeneration of the optic nerve due to chronic elevated intraocular pressure",
    "Lens dislocation into the anterior chamber obstructing the canal of Schlemm"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Sudden blockage of aqueous outflow through the pupil leading to iris apposition to the trabecular meshwork. Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the anterior chamber angle becomes occluded, preventing aqueous humor from draining through the trabecular meshwork. This is often triggered by pupillary dilation in anatomically predisposed individuals, leading to forward bowing of the iris (iris bombe), which blocks the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior to anterior chamber. This dramatically raises intraocular pressure and is an ophthalmologic emergency. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Increased aqueous humor production – Incorrect. Overproduction is not the cause; the problem lies in outflow obstruction. 2. Inflammatory debris – Incorrect. This describes uveitis or secondary open-angle glaucoma, not angle-closure glaucoma. 4. Optic nerve degeneration – Incorrect. This is a consequence of chronic glaucoma, not the initial event in acute angle-closure. 5. Lens dislocation – Incorrect. This is rare and usually post-traumatic; it does not describe the common mechanism of acute angle-closure glaucoma."

  "question": "A 66-year-old man with chronic open-angle glaucoma is prescribed multiple medications to lower his intraocular pressure. One of the medications prescribed decreases aqueous humor production by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary epithelium. Which of the following drugs most likely exerts its effect via this mechanism?",
  "choices": [
    "Latanoprost",
    "Brimonidine",
    "Acetazolamide",
    "Timolol",
    "Pilocarpine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Timolol. Timolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that reduces intraocular pressure by inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary body epithelium, thereby decreasing aqueous humor production. It is commonly used as a first-line agent in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Latanoprost – Incorrect. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog that increases uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor, not production. 2. Brimonidine – Incorrect. Brimonidine is an alpha-2 agonist that decreases aqueous humor production and increases outflow, but not via beta-blockade. 3. Acetazolamide – Incorrect. This is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that also reduces aqueous humor production, but through inhibition of bicarbonate formation, not beta receptors. 5. Pilocarpine – Incorrect. Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that increases trabecular outflow by contracting the ciliary muscle and opening the angle."

On exam, he has right-sided hemiparesis and loss of fine touch and proprioception. His gaze is deviated toward the left, and he has a left-sided facial droop with dysarthria. Which of the following arteries is most likely occluded in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Left anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)",
    "Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)",
    "Left paramedian branches of the basilar artery",
    "Right posterior cerebral artery (PCA)",
    "Left middle cerebral artery (MCA)"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Left paramedian branches of the basilar artery. This patient has medial pontine syndrome (a subtype of medial brainstem syndromes), typically caused by occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery. The syndrome includes contralateral hemiparesis (due to corticospinal tract involvement), contralateral loss of proprioception and fine touch (medial lemniscus), and ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness (due to facial nerve fascicle involvement in the pons). Eye deviation toward the lesion may occur due to involvement of the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). Incorrect answer explanations: 1. AICA – Incorrect. AICA infarcts cause lateral pontine syndrome, not medial pontine syndrome. 2. PICA – Incorrect. PICA infarcts cause lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. 4. PCA – Incorrect. PCA infarcts affect the occipital lobe and midbrain, leading to contralateral homonymous hemianopia, not this presentation. 5. MCA – Incorrect. MCA strokes typically cause contralateral face and arm weakness and aphasia (if dominant hemisphere), not crossed findings seen in brainstem strokes."

Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus and a positive Romberg sign that worsens with eyes closed. The physician suspects a vestibular disorder affecting input from the semicircular canals. Which of the following best describes the normal physiologic role of these structures?",
  "choices": [
    "Detect linear acceleration and head position relative to gravity",
    "Transmit auditory signals from the cochlea to the brainstem",
    "Sense angular acceleration of the head and initiate compensatory eye movements",
    "Coordinate voluntary head and neck movements through corticospinal pathways",
    "Relay proprioceptive input from cervical spinal nerves to the cerebellum"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Sense angular acceleration of the head and initiate compensatory eye movements. The semicircular canals are part of the vestibular system and are responsible for detecting angular (rotational) acceleration of the head. They contain hair cells within the ampullae that are displaced by movement of endolymph, triggering signals transmitted via the vestibular nerve. These inputs help coordinate the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which stabilizes gaze during head movements. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Linear acceleration – Incorrect. The utricle and saccule (otolith organs), not the semicircular canals, detect linear acceleration and head position. 2. Auditory signals – Incorrect. This is the function of the cochlea and auditory nerve, not the semicircular canals. 4. Corticospinal coordination – Incorrect. Voluntary head and neck movement is mediated by descending motor pathways, not the vestibular system. 5. Proprioceptive input – Incorrect. This involves dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts, not the vestibular apparatus."

Which of the following best explains the underlying pathophysiology of this patient’s symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Demyelination of central vestibular pathways in the brainstem",
    "Transient ischemia of the cerebellar vermis",
    "Disruption of endolymph flow or hair cell activation in the semicircular canals",
    "Obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the fourth ventricle",
    "Infarction of the medial longitudinal fasciculus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Disruption of endolymph flow or hair cell activation in the semicircular canals. Vertigo is the false sensation of movement, typically caused by dysfunction of the vestibular system. In peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), abnormal stimulation or dysfunction of hair cells in the semicircular canals or otolith organs leads to mismatched signals between the inner ear and visual/proprioceptive systems, resulting in vertigo. Nystagmus that suppresses with fixation and absence of other focal neurologic deficits point toward a peripheral cause. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Demyelination – Incorrect. This may cause central vertigo, such as in multiple sclerosis, but would usually involve other neurologic findings. 2. Cerebellar ischemia – Incorrect. Central vertigo from a cerebellar stroke often includes ataxia, dysmetria, or vertical nystagmus, which are not present here. 4. CSF flow obstruction – Incorrect. This would cause signs of increased intracranial pressure, not isolated vertigo. 5. MLF infarction – Incorrect. This causes internuclear ophthalmoplegia, typically seen in multiple sclerosis or stroke, not isolated vertigo."

Bilateral damage, such as from temporal lobe surgery or anoxia, can result in profound anterograde amnesia. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Amygdala – Incorrect. The amygdala is primarily involved in emotional processing, especially fear and aggression, but not in the formation of declarative memory. 2. Cingulate gyrus – Incorrect. It plays a role in emotion and attention, but isolated damage does not cause memory deficits. 3. Mammillary bodies – Incorrect. These are part of the Papez circuit and involved in memory but are more classically associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to thiamine deficiency. 5. Caudate nucleus – Incorrect. This is part of the basal ganglia involved in motor control and habit learning, not declarative memory formation."

  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Conductive hearing loss due to cerumen impaction. A negative Rinne test (bone > air conduction) and Weber test lateralizing to the affected ear are classic for conductive hearing loss. In this case, the most common cause in an elderly patient is cerumen impaction. Conductive loss occurs when sound conduction through the external or middle ear is blocked. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Presbycusis – Incorrect. This is a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss due to aging and would not produce the unilateral findings described. 2. Aminoglycoside toxicity – Incorrect. Causes bilateral sensorineural loss, typically high-frequency. 3. Acoustic neuroma – Incorrect. Causes unilateral sensorineural loss, but the Rinne test would be normal (air > bone) and Weber would lateralize to the opposite ear. 4. Basilar membrane damage – Incorrect. Sensorineural loss affects the inner ear or auditory nerve and would show a positive Rinne and Weber lateralizing away from the affected side."

Phenytoin stabilizes neuronal membranes by prolonging the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby preventing high-frequency repetitive firing. It is used for focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures and is commonly prescribed in adults. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Ethosuximide – Incorrect. This drug is specific for absence seizures and acts by inhibiting T-type calcium channels. 3. Valproic acid – Incorrect. It works by increasing GABA and inhibiting sodium channels but is more commonly used for generalized epilepsy, including myoclonic and absence seizures. 4. Levetiracetam – Incorrect. Its exact mechanism is unknown but involves modulation of synaptic vesicle proteins (SV2A); not primarily sodium channel based. 5. Topiramate – Incorrect.

The patient's eyes remain fixed and do not move conjugately. Which of the following best explains the clinical significance of this finding?",
  "choices": [
    "This response indicates intact cortical function but impaired brainstem activity",
    "The finding is consistent with psychogenic unresponsiveness",

    "This test evaluates cerebellar function by assessing smooth pursuit movements"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: This indicates loss of vestibulo-ocular reflex and suggests brainstem dysfunction. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), tested with the oculocephalic maneuver, evaluates the integrity of the brainstem — specifically the connections between the vestibular nuclei and cranial nerves III and VI. In a comatose patient, failure of the eyes to move conjugately in response to head turning is a sign of brainstem damage. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Intact cortical function – Incorrect. The VOR is a brainstem reflex and does not require cortical input. 2. Psychogenic unresponsiveness – Incorrect. Patients with psychogenic coma typically have intact VOR. 4. Normal response – Incorrect. A normal VOR response is conjugate movement opposite to head turn. Fixed eyes suggest an abnormal (brainstem-injured) response. 5. Cerebellar testing – Incorrect.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Medulloblastoma",
    "Ependymoma",
    "Pilocytic astrocytoma",
    "Neuroblastoma",
    "Craniopharyngioma"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Pilocytic astrocytoma. This is the most common brain tumor in children, typically located in the posterior fossa (especially the cerebellum). Imaging often shows a cystic lesion with an enhancing mural nodule. Histologically, it is characterized by Rosenthal fibers (corkscrew-shaped eosinophilic structures) and eosinophilic granular bodies. It is WHO grade I and generally has a good prognosis. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Medulloblastoma – Incorrect. Also a posterior fossa tumor, but it is more aggressive, often midline, and may show small round blue cells with Homer Wright rosettes. 2. Ependymoma – Incorrect. Typically arises from the fourth ventricle, can cause hydrocephalus, and shows perivascular pseudorosettes on histology. 4. Neuroblastoma – Incorrect. A tumor of the sympathetic chain or adrenal medulla, not the brain; may metastasize to the CNS but is not a primary CNS tumor. 5. Craniopharyngioma – Incorrect. Usually suprasellar and presents with visual disturbances or hormonal dysfunction; shows calcifications and cystic components on imaging."

    "Schwannoma",
    "Oligodendroglioma",
    "Ependymoma",
    "Meningioma"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Meningioma. Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial tumors in adults, especially in middle-aged women. They arise from arachnoid cap cells and are often located near the falx cerebri or convexities. Radiographically, they are extra-axial, enhance homogeneously, and may show a dural tail. Histology classically reveals whorled patterns and psammoma bodies. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Glioblastoma multiforme – Incorrect. A highly malignant intra-axial tumor that crosses the corpus callosum (butterfly glioma), with necrosis and pseudopalisading cells. 2. Schwannoma – Incorrect. Often arises from CN VIII at the cerebellopontine angle, presenting with hearing loss; S100 positive on histology. 3. Oligodendroglioma – Incorrect. Typically presents with seizures; histology shows 'fried egg' cells and calcifications but is intra-axial and slower-growing. 4. Ependymoma – Incorrect. More common in children; arises in the ventricles (especially fourth), shows perivascular pseudorosettes."

A stereotactic biopsy is performed, and histology shows round cells with clear perinuclear halos ('fried egg' appearance) and delicate capillary networks ('chicken-wire' vasculature). Molecular testing confirms a 1p/19q codeletion. Which of the following best describes the clinical significance of this genetic alteration?",
  "choices": [
    "Indicates high-grade transformation into glioblastoma",
    "Predicts better prognosis and favorable response to chemotherapy",
    "Associated with poor response to radiation therapy",
    "Suggests medulloblastoma subtype with MYC amplification",
    "Indicative of ependymoma arising in the spinal cord"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Predicts better prognosis and favorable response to chemotherapy. Oligodendrogliomas are IDH-mutant, 1p/19q codeleted tumors that typically arise in the frontal lobes of adults. The 1p/19q co-deletion is both diagnostic and prognostic, associated with longer survival and better response to alkylating agents like temozolomide and to radiation therapy. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Glioblastoma transformation – Incorrect. High-grade gliomas often lack the 1p/19q deletion and are more commonly IDH-wild type. 3. Poor radiation response – Incorrect. The co-deletion actually enhances sensitivity to radiation. 4. MYC amplification – Incorrect. Seen in some aggressive medulloblastoma subtypes, not oligodendroglioma. 5. Spinal ependymoma – Incorrect. Ependymomas are not associated with 1p/19q deletions and have different histology."

    "Schwannoma – Ring-enhancing mass with midline shift; Ependymoma – Supratentorial cortical mass",
    "Craniopharyngioma – Butterfly lesion; Metastatic lesion – Mural nodule with cyst in cerebellum"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Oligodendroglioma – Calcified cortical mass; Glioblastoma – Ring-enhancing lesion crossing corpus callosum. Oligodendrogliomas often appear as well-demarcated, calcified masses in the cortex, commonly in the frontal lobes. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) classically presents with a ring-enhancing lesion that can cross the corpus callosum, producing the 'butterfly glioma' appearance, often accompanied by vasogenic edema. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Pilocytic astrocytoma – Incorrect. This tumor more commonly presents in children and shows a cyst with mural nodule, not a butterfly lesion. 2. Meningioma – Incorrect. Meningiomas are well-circumscribed, dural-based, and strongly enhancing. 4. Schwannoma – Incorrect. Schwannomas are usually at the cerebellopontine angle and enhance homogeneously; ependymomas typically arise near ventricles. 5. Craniopharyngioma – Incorrect.

  "question": "A 32-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus presents with sudden-onset headache, visual disturbances, confusion, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Her blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg. MRI of the brain shows symmetric hyperintensities in the parieto-occipital white matter on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Vasculitis-induced microinfarcts in the occipital cortex",
    "Cytotoxic edema from neuronal apoptosis in the visual cortex",
    "Breakdown of cerebral autoregulation causing vasogenic edema",
    "Thrombotic occlusion of the posterior cerebral arteries",
    "Neuronal demyelination due to anti-MOG antibodies"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Breakdown of cerebral autoregulation causing vasogenic edema. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is characterized by vasogenic edema, primarily in the posterior cerebral hemispheres, due to failure of cerebral autoregulation in the setting of acute hypertension, immunosuppression, or autoimmune disease. This leads to leakage of fluid into the white matter, especially in the parieto-occipital regions. Symptoms include headache, visual disturbances, seizures, and altered mental status. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Vasculitis – Incorrect. While autoimmune conditions like SLE can predispose to PRES, the mechanism is not infarction but vasogenic edema. 2. Cytotoxic edema – Incorrect. This occurs in ischemic strokes, not in PRES. 4. PCA occlusion – Incorrect. This would result in infarction and cortical blindness, not vasogenic edema with reversible changes. 5. Anti-MOG antibodies – Incorrect. These are associated with demyelinating syndromes such as ADEM or NMOSD, not PRES."

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Fluctuating level of consciousness. Delirium is characterized by acute onset, fluctuating consciousness, impaired attention, and disorientation. Visual hallucinations are common, especially in elderly or medically ill patients. In contrast, catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome often associated with psychiatric illness and features mutism, stupor, and waxy flexibility, but consciousness is typically preserved. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Psychotic symptoms – Incorrect. Both conditions can include hallucinations or odd behaviors, though the context differs. 3. Abnormal motor behaviors – Incorrect. These are classic for catatonia, not delirium. 4. Psychiatric history – Incorrect. Though common in catatonia, delirium can occur in any patient, especially those acutely ill. 5. EEG findings – Incorrect. Delirium typically shows diffuse slowing; catatonia often has normal EEG."

In another, a loud noise is turned off when a child stops yelling. Which of the following best describes the principle being applied in both scenarios?",
  "choices": [
    "Operant conditioning",
    "Classical conditioning",
    "Habituation",
    "Extinction",
    "Modeling"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Operant conditioning. This is a type of learning in which behavior is modified by consequences. Positive reinforcement (e.g., giving candy) increases behavior by providing a reward, while negative reinforcement (e.g., removing an unpleasant stimulus like a loud noise) also increases behavior by taking away something aversive. Both examples fall under operant conditioning. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Classical conditioning – Incorrect. This involves associating an involuntary response with a stimulus (e.g., Pavlov’s dogs salivating to a bell). 2. Habituation – Incorrect. A decrease in response to a repeated, benign stimulus. 3. Extinction – Incorrect. The disappearance of a learned behavior when reinforcement is removed. 4. Modeling – Incorrect. Involves learning through observation and imitation, not reinforcement."

    "Temporal lobe epilepsy",
    "Absence seizure"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES). PNES are episodes that resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with abnormal electrical activity. Clues include prolonged duration, asynchronous or unusual movements (e.g., side-to-side head shaking, pelvic thrusting), retained awareness, and lack of postictal confusion. They often occur in individuals with a history of psychological trauma or psychiatric comorbidities. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure – Incorrect. These typically involve sudden loss of consciousness, synchronous movements, and postictal confusion. 3. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy – Incorrect. Characterized by morning myoclonic jerks, not prolonged convulsions. 4. Temporal lobe epilepsy – Incorrect. Presents with focal impaired awareness, often with automatisms or déjà vu sensations. 5.

His affect is flat, and he reports persistent low mood. Alterations in which of the following neurotransmitter systems are most strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "GABA in the nucleus accumbens",
    "Glutamate in the prefrontal cortex",
    "Acetylcholine in the basal forebrain",
    "Dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway",
    "Serotonin and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Serotonin and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Major depressive disorder is associated with decreased monoaminergic activity, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters modulate mood, cognition, and arousal. Most antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs) work by increasing synaptic levels of these monoamines. Incorrect answer explanations: 1. GABA in the nucleus accumbens – Incorrect. GABA is more relevant in anxiety and seizure disorders. 2. Glutamate in the prefrontal cortex – Incorrect. Glutamatergic dysregulation is more associated with schizophrenia and excitotoxicity in neurodegeneration. 3. Acetylcholine in the basal forebrain – Incorrect. Primarily implicated in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive disorders. 4. Dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway – Incorrect. Associated with positive symptoms in schizophrenia, not depression."

  "question": "A 38-year-old man with recently diagnosed HIV infection presents for follow-up. His CD4 count is 540/µL and his viral load is undetectable after 6 months of antiretroviral therapy. He reports adherence to his medication but expresses feelings of shame and fears that others will discover his diagnosis. He has avoided social gatherings and has become increasingly withdrawn. He denies suicidal thoughts. Which of the following psychosocial interventions is most appropriate to improve his long-term health outcomes?",
  "choices": [
    "Switching to a different antiretroviral regimen",
    "Encouraging disclosure of his HIV status to all coworkers",
    "Referral to a support group for individuals living with HIV",
    "Increasing the frequency of viral load monitoring",
    "Starting empiric antidepressant medication immediately"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Referral to a support group for individuals living with HIV. Psychosocial support is critical in HIV management because stigma, isolation, and depression are major barriers to adherence and overall health. Peer support can reduce stigma, improve coping, and enhance long-term adherence to therapy. Incorrect answers: 1. Switching antiretroviral therapy – Incorrect. His regimen is effective; adherence is not the issue. 2. Encouraging disclosure to all coworkers – Incorrect. Disclosure is a personal choice and should be tailored to supportive environments; forced disclosure can worsen stigma. 3. Referral to support group – Correct. Evidence shows peer support improves psychosocial outcomes and medication adherence. 4. Increasing viral load monitoring – Incorrect. His labs are stable; increased monitoring does not address psychosocial distress. 5. Empiric antidepressants – Incorrect. While depression screening is important, he denies depressive symptoms such as anhedonia or suicidality; psychosocial support is first-line in addressing isolation and stigma."

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lithium. In patients with bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, or certain antipsychotics) are first-line treatments to prevent both mania and depression. Antidepressant monotherapy (such as fluoxetine or bupropion) is contraindicated because it can precipitate mania. Incorrect answers: 1. Lithium – Correct. Effective for both acute bipolar depression and maintenance therapy, and reduces suicide risk. 2. Fluoxetine monotherapy – Incorrect. Antidepressant monotherapy is not used in bipolar disorder due to risk of triggering mania. 3. Olanzapine-fluoxetine – Incorrect. This combination can be used in **treatment-resistant bipolar depression**, but first-line therapy is a mood stabilizer (eg, lithium or lamotrigine). 4. Valproate – Incorrect. Effective for mania and maintenance, but less effective for acute bipolar depression than lithium or lamotrigine. 5. Bupropion monotherapy – Incorrect.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Downregulation of dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic pathway. Addiction involves dysregulation of the brain's reward system, particularly the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (ventral tegmental area → nucleus accumbens). Chronic drug use leads to tolerance via receptor downregulation, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect, and compulsive drug-seeking despite harm. Incorrect answers: 1. Upregulation of D2 receptors – Incorrect. Chronic stimulation causes downregulation, not upregulation. 2. Enhanced GABAergic inhibition – Incorrect. Would reduce excitability, not cause addiction-related tolerance. 3. Downregulation of dopamine receptors – Correct. Explains tolerance and compulsive use. 4. Increased serotonin release – Incorrect. Relevant to mood regulation, not primary mechanism of addiction. 5. Suppression of hippocampal glutamate – Incorrect. Would impair memory, not core to addiction physiology."

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Projection. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or failures to others. In this case, the student projects responsibility for his poor performance onto his teacher instead of acknowledging his lack of preparation. Incorrect answers: 1. Displacement – Incorrect. Shifting emotions from one target to a safer alternative (eg, yelling at a sibling instead of a boss). 2. Reaction formation – Incorrect. Expressing the opposite of an unacceptable impulse (eg, treating someone you dislike overly kindly). 3. Sublimation – Incorrect. Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities (eg, using aggressive impulses in sports). 4. Projection – Correct. Blaming others for one’s shortcomings or attributing own unacceptable feelings to others. 5. Regression – Incorrect. Reverting to immature behavior patterns under stress (eg, bedwetting in a previously toilet-trained child)."

  "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a history of generalized anxiety disorder reports persistent worry about her health, finances, and job security. She says she often thinks, 'If I make one mistake, I’ll lose everything.' Her therapist encourages her to identify these automatic thoughts, evaluate their accuracy, and replace them with more balanced statements. Which of the following best describes the therapeutic technique being used?",
  "choices": [
    "Systematic desensitization",
    "Exposure therapy",
    "Cognitive restructuring",
    "Behavioral activation",
    "Psychodynamic interpretation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Cognitive restructuring. CBT targets maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. Cognitive restructuring involves identifying and challenging distorted automatic thoughts and replacing them with more realistic ones. Incorrect answers: 1. Systematic desensitization – Incorrect. Gradual exposure to feared stimuli paired with relaxation techniques, used for phobias. 2. Exposure therapy – Incorrect. Confrontation with feared stimuli to reduce avoidance, often used for phobias or OCD. 3. Cognitive restructuring – Correct. Identifying and replacing maladaptive automatic thoughts. 4. Behavioral activation – Incorrect. Encouraging engagement in positive activities to counteract depression, not focused on cognitive distortions. 5. Psychodynamic interpretation – Incorrect. Explores unconscious conflicts and past experiences, not core to CBT."

  "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with right-sided hemiparesis and loss of vibration and proprioception in the right leg and arm. He also has left-sided tongue weakness with tongue deviation toward the left when protruded. Which of the following best localizes the lesion?",
  "choices": [
    "Left lateral medulla",
    "Right midbrain",
    "Left medial medulla",
    "Right pons",
    "Left cerebellar hemisphere"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Left medial medulla. Medial medullary syndrome is caused by infarction of the anterior spinal artery and involves contralateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract), contralateral loss of vibration/proprioception (medial lemniscus), and ipsilateral tongue weakness (CN XII). Incorrect answers: 1. Left lateral medulla – Incorrect. Would cause Wallenberg syndrome: contralateral pain/temp loss, ipsilateral face pain/temp loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, vertigo. 2. Right midbrain – Incorrect. Would cause oculomotor palsy and contralateral hemiparesis (Weber syndrome). 3. Left medial medulla – Correct. Explains contralateral weakness/sensory loss and ipsilateral tongue deviation. 4. Right pons – Incorrect. Could involve facial weakness and gaze palsy, not tongue findings. 5. Left cerebellar hemisphere – Incorrect. Causes ipsilateral ataxia, dysmetria, intention tremor, not tongue deviation or hemiparesis."

  "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with burns on his hands after failing to notice contact with a hot pan. On exam, he has bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the upper extremities but preserved light touch, vibration, and proprioception. Muscle strength is mildly reduced in the hands. Which of the following best explains his condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Destruction of the anterior horn cells",
    "Compression of the dorsal columns",
    "Disruption of the anterior white commissure",
    "Lesion of the corticospinal tracts",
    "Degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Disruption of the anterior white commissure. Syringomyelia involves cystic degeneration of the spinal cord, commonly in the cervical region, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation due to disruption of crossing spinothalamic fibers in the anterior white commissure. Incorrect answers: 1. Anterior horn cell loss – Incorrect. Seen in poliomyelitis and ALS, causing motor weakness, not selective pain/temp loss. 2. Dorsal column compression – Incorrect. Would cause loss of vibration and proprioception, which are intact. 3. Anterior white commissure – Correct. Explains selective pain and temperature loss with preserved dorsal column function. 4. Corticospinal tract lesion – Incorrect. Causes spastic paralysis and hyperreflexia, not selective sensory loss. 5. Dorsal root ganglia degeneration – Incorrect. Seen in tabes dorsalis, with impaired proprioception and sensory ataxia."
