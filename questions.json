    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department after cutting her forearm with a razor. She denies any intent to die and reports that she did it to 'feel something' and relieve her emotional distress. She has a history of depression and anxiety. What is the most appropriate classification of this behavior?",
    "choices": [
      "Suicide attempt with low lethality",
      "Nonsuicidal self-injury",
      "Manipulative gesture",
      "Parasuicidal behavior",
      "Suicidal ideation with plan"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Nonsuicidal self-injury. NSSI refers to the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent, most commonly for emotion regulation or self-punishment. It is distinct from suicidal behaviors in that there is no intent to die. Labeling the behavior as a 'manipulative gesture' is stigmatizing and clinically inaccurate. While the behavior is a risk factor for future suicide attempts, it does not represent a suicide attempt itself unless accompanied by intent to die."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with intense agitation, insomnia, and ruminative thoughts of being trapped in a hopeless life situation. He describes emotional pain and has recently withdrawn from all social contact. His clinical picture is consistent with Suicide Crisis Syndrome. Which of the following components best characterizes this syndrome?",
    "choices": [
      "Euphoria followed by impulsive behavior and flight of ideas",
      "Persistent grandiosity and hallucinations",
      "Emotional pain, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and acute social withdrawal",
      "Somatic delusions and passive death wishes",
      "Apathy and flat affect with poor insight"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Emotional pain, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and acute social withdrawal. Suicide Crisis Syndrome is characterized by a cluster of symptoms that precede acute suicide risk, including a frantic sense of entrapment, extreme emotional pain, mood lability, cognitive rigidity, and social withdrawal. It helps clinicians recognize high-risk individuals even in the absence of an explicit suicide plan. It is distinct from manic episodes or psychotic disorders."

  {
    "question": "A 26-year-old woman with chronic suicidal ideation agrees to collaborate on a Crisis Response Plan (CRP) after expressing distress over losing her job. Which of the following components is most essential to include in her written CRP to reduce suicide risk effectively?",
    "choices": [
      "A contract stating she will not attempt suicide",
      "A daily log of negative thoughts",
      "A list of warning signs, coping strategies, reasons to live, supportive contacts, and plan to restrict access to lethal means",
      "Her diagnosis and a summary of previous psychiatric hospitalizations",
      "A calendar of follow-up psychiatry appointments only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: A list of warning signs, coping strategies, reasons to live, supportive contacts, and plan to restrict access to lethal means. Crisis Response Planning is a brief, evidence-based intervention shown to reduce suicide attempts significantly. It includes personalized coping strategies, early warning signs, reasons for living, social support contacts, and steps to reduce access to lethal means. Unlike no-suicide contracts, which lack evidence of efficacy, CRPs engage the patient in active safety planning and promote autonomy."

    "question": "A 31-year-old man with schizophrenia develops muscle rigidity, confusion, fever, and elevated creatine kinase one week after starting a high-potency typical antipsychotic. He is diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Which of the following best explains the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Excessive dopamine stimulation in the mesocortical tract",
      "Antagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex",
      "D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal and hypothalamic pathways",
      "Agonism at 5-HT1A receptors in the limbic system",
      "Upregulation of NMDA receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal and hypothalamic pathways. NMS is a life-threatening reaction to antipsychotics, especially high-potency typicals like haloperidol, characterized by rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and altered mental status. It is primarily due to sudden, profound blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal and hypothalamic pathways. This disrupts thermoregulation and motor control. Serotonin antagonism and NMDA receptor upregulation are more associated with atypical antipsychotic effects and schizophrenia pathophysiology, respectively."

  {
    "question": "A 42-year-old woman with schizophrenia is started on risperidone. After three months, she presents with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated serum prolactin. Which dopaminergic pathway is most likely responsible for her symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Mesolimbic",
      "Mesocortical",
      "Nigrostriatal",
      "Tuberoinfundibular",
      "Reticulospinal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Tuberoinfundibular. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary via the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Antipsychotics that block D2 receptors (especially risperidone) can disinhibit prolactin release, leading to hyperprolactinemia, which manifests as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and sexual dysfunction. The mesolimbic pathway is targeted for antipsychotic efficacy, while the nigrostriatal pathway mediates extrapyramidal symptoms. The mesocortical pathway is associated with negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia."

  {
    "question": "A 28-year-old man with schizophrenia is treated with aripiprazole. He reports significant improvement in affect and minimal side effects. Which of the following best describes aripiprazoleâ€™s mechanism of action and why it is less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Inverse agonist at D2 receptors and antagonist at 5-HT2C receptors",
      "High-affinity antagonist at both D1 and D2 receptors",
      "Partial agonist at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors",
      "Irreversible antagonist at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic tract",
      "Selective antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors with no dopaminergic activity"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Partial agonist at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic with a unique mechanism. As a partial agonist at D2 receptors, it stabilizes dopaminergic activity rather than completely blocking it, reducing risk of extrapyramidal side effects. It also antagonizes 5-HT2A receptors, helping to alleviate negative symptoms. It does not act as a full antagonist or irreversible binder at D2, nor is it selective only for serotonin receptors."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents with persistent anxiety symptoms including muscle tension, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. She reports that her worries span several domains of life including work, finances, and family, and have persisted for the last 9 months. She has no history of substance use, and medical work-up is unremarkable. Which of the following pharmacological agents is most appropriate as first-line treatment, and what is the most likely mechanism by which it alleviates her symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Alprazolam; potentiation of GABA-A receptor activity",
      "Amitriptyline; inhibition of histamine and muscarinic receptors",
      "Propranolol; antagonism of peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors",
      "Sertraline; blockade of serotonin reuptake at the presynaptic terminal",
      "Gabapentin; modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Sertraline; blockade of serotonin reuptake at the presynaptic terminal. This patient meets criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), characterized by chronic, excessive, and uncontrollable worry across various life domains. SSRIs such as sertraline are first-line pharmacologic treatments for GAD. They increase serotonin availability by inhibiting its reuptake, thus enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is not first-line due to risk of dependence. Amitriptyline and gabapentin are not recommended as initial therapy. Propranolol may help performance anxiety but not generalized anxiety."

    "question": "A 17-year-old high school student presents with severe anxiety surrounding classroom presentations. He experiences excessive fear of being judged, avoids eye contact, and has started skipping school to avoid these situations. He reports no panic attacks outside of social settings and feels generally calm otherwise. Which of the following features would best distinguish his condition from avoidant personality disorder?",
    "choices": [
      "Early onset in adolescence",
      "Functional impairment due to social fears",
      "Co-occurrence with depressive symptoms",
      "Capacity for normal social functioning with familiar individuals",
      "Fear of negative evaluation from others"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Capacity for normal social functioning with familiar individuals. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) can resemble avoidant personality disorder (AVPD), but a key distinction is that individuals with SAD often function normally in comfortable social contexts (e.g., with family or close friends), whereas AVPD involves pervasive interpersonal avoidance across all contexts. Both disorders may have early onset and cause functional impairment due to fear of evaluation. Co-occurrence with depression is common in both but not distinguishing."

    "question": "A clinical trial is evaluating neural correlates of various anxiety disorders. One subset of patients exhibits hyperactivity in the locus coeruleus and elevated catecholamine levels in response to minimal stimuli. Which of the following neurotransmitters is most likely contributing to the somatic symptoms observed in these patients, such as increased heart rate, tremors, and heightened vigilance?",
    "choices": [
      "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)",
      "Glutamate",
      "Serotonin (5-HT)",
      "Dopamine",
      "Norepinephrine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Norepinephrine. Hyperactivity in the locus coeruleus and the sympathetic nervous system is associated with increased norepinephrine release, contributing to arousal, vigilance, and somatic symptoms such as tachycardia, sweating, and tremorâ€”common in anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder. GABA is inhibitory and tends to reduce anxiety. Serotonin dysregulation is associated with anxiety but is more related to mood and emotional regulation. Glutamate is excitatory but not directly implicated in the specific autonomic symptoms. Dopamine plays a more prominent role in reward and psychotic disorders."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and comorbid major depressive disorder is initiated on an appropriate pharmacologic treatment. Two days later, she returns with complaints of increased restlessness and insomnia. Which of the following best explains the cause of her current symptoms, and what is the most appropriate next step?",
    "choices": [
      "Adverse interaction between SRI and benzodiazepine; discontinue both drugs immediately",
      "Delayed therapeutic onset of SSRI with transient anxiogenic effects; provide supportive care and monitor",
      "Development of serotonin syndrome; discontinue SSRI and administer cyproheptadine",
      "Onset of atypical depression; switch to a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor",
      "Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms; reinitiate benzodiazepine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Delayed therapeutic onset of SSRI with transient anxiogenic effects; provide supportive care and monitor. SSRIs are first-line for GAD but may cause increased anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia in the initial days of treatment due to serotonergic modulation before receptor downregulation occurs. These effects typically resolve within 1â€“2 weeks. Benzodiazepines may be used transiently to bridge this period, but immediate cessation is not recommended. There is no indication of serotonin syndrome in this case. NDRIs like bupropion are not first-line for anxiety."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man with panic disorder is started on alprazolam for acute symptom management while awaiting response to an SSRI. He reports improvement but misses a follow-up visit and abruptly stops taking the alprazolam. Two days later, he presents with tremors, insomnia, and worsening anxiety. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of his current condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leading to catecholaminergic toxicity",
      "Dysregulation of 5HT1A signaling from buspirone discontinuation",
      "Rebound cholinergic activity from muscarinic blockade",
      "Acute GABA-A receptor downregulation and compensatory CNS hyperexcitability",
      "Serotonin depletion in the prefrontal cortex due to rapid SSRI withdrawal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Acute GABA-A receptor downregulation and compensatory CNS hyperexcitability. Benzodiazepines like alprazolam enhance GABA-A activity and can lead to physiological dependence. Abrupt cessation results in CNS hyperexcitability due to receptor downregulation and decreased inhibitory tone, manifesting as tremors, anxiety, and insomnia. Gradual tapering is essential. SSRI withdrawal typically has a different profile and occurs over days to weeks, not days. Buspirone and muscarinic effects are not relevant here."

    "question": "A 39-year-old woman with anxiety symptoms and a past history of substance use disorder seeks pharmacologic treatment. She refuses SSRIs due to previous adverse sexual side effects and requests a medication that will not impair cognition or lead to dependence. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacologic choice for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Diazepam",
      "Buspirone",
      "Hydroxyzine",
      "Venlafaxine",
      "Clonazepam"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Buspirone. Buspirone is a 5HT1A partial agonist with anxiolytic properties and a low risk of sedation, psychomotor impairment, or dependence. It is a suitable alternative in patients with substance use disorders or those concerned about sexual side effects and cognitive impairment. SSRIs and SNRIs can cause sexual dysfunction. Benzodiazepines like diazepam and clonazepam carry dependence risks. Hydroxyzine is sedating and often used short-term but may not be ideal for long-term maintenance in functional individuals."

He believes he is on the verge of launching a multi-million-dollar startup despite lacking any background in business. His family brings him to the ED due to recent reckless spending and aggressive outbursts. He is not on any medications and has no substance use. Which of the following findings, if present, would distinguish this presentation from hypomania?",
    "choices": [
      "Elevated mood",
      "Increased goal-directed activity",
      "Grandiosity",
      "Marked impairment in occupational and social functioning",
      "Duration of at least 7 days"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Marked impairment in occupational and social functioning. The key distinction between a manic and hypomanic episode is severity. While both share similar symptoms such as elevated mood, increased energy, and grandiosity, manic episodes are associated with significant impairment or require hospitalization. Hypomanic episodes, by contrast, do not cause marked impairment or require hospitalization, and do not include psychotic features. A duration of at least 4 days is sufficient for hypomania, while mania requires at least 7 days unless hospitalization occurs earlier."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder is hospitalized for mania. She is started on lithium, and her mood symptoms begin to improve over the following week. On day 10 of hospitalization, she develops confusion, dysarthria, and coarse tremors. Serum lithium level is 2.3 mmol/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Administer flumazenil",
      "Start propranolol",
      "Administer naloxone",
      "Initiate hemodialysis",
      "Increase fluid intake only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Initiate hemodialysis. This patient has symptoms of acute lithium toxicity (confusion, ataxia, dysarthria, tremor) with a serum level above 2.0 mmol/L. In cases of severe toxicity or impaired renal clearance, hemodialysis is the treatment of choice due to lithiumâ€™s low molecular weight and lack of protein binding. Supportive therapy alone is not sufficient at this level. Naloxone and flumazenil are specific antidotes for opioids and benzodiazepines, respectively. Propranolol is sometimes used for lithium-induced tremor but is inappropriate here."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman is being evaluated for mood symptoms. She reports periods lasting 4â€“5 days of elevated mood, decreased sleep, and increased productivity, followed by weeks of intense sadness, fatigue, and suicidal ideation. She has no history of psychosis or hospitalization. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis, and which treatment would best address her depressive symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Bipolar I disorder; treat with fluoxetine monotherapy",
      "Major depressive disorder; initiate sertraline",
      "Bipolar II disorder; initiate lamotrigine",
      "Cyclothymic disorder; treat with bupropion",
      "Persistent depressive disorder; initiate mirtazapine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Bipolar II disorder; initiate lamotrigine. This patient has clear episodes of hypomania (lasting 4â€“5 days without psychosis or hospitalization) alternating with major depressive episodes, which defines bipolar II disorder. Lamotrigine is an FDA-approved mood stabilizer for bipolar depression and is preferred because of its favorable side-effect profile. SSRIs or SNRIs used as monotherapy can precipitate mania or rapid cycling in bipolar patients. Cyclothymia involves subthreshold symptoms. Mirtazapine and bupropion are not first-line for bipolar depression."

  {
    "question": "A 26-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder is stabilized on lithium for maintenance therapy. She presents with new-onset confusion, ataxia, and slurred speech. Her lithium level is 1.1 mmol/L (therapeutic range: 0.6â€“1.2 mmol/L). Her BUN and creatinine are elevated. She reports profuse diarrhea and fever over the past two days. Which of the following best explains her clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Serotonin syndrome due to recent SSRI initiation",
      "Central pontine myelinolysis due to rapid sodium correction",
      "Lithium toxicity secondary to volume depletion",
      "Acute valproate toxicity due to hepatic failure",
      "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome from antipsychotic therapy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lithium toxicity secondary to volume depletion. Despite being within the therapeutic range, lithium toxicity can occur when volume depletion (from diarrhea, fever, or dehydration) reduces renal clearance. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and is exclusively excreted by the kidneys. Conditions that impair renal functionâ€”such as dehydrationâ€”can elevate tissue concentrations without drastically increasing serum levels. Symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and slurred speech are classic for lithium toxicity. SSRI-related serotonin syndrome would present with clonus and hyperreflexia. Valproate toxicity involves hepatic symptoms, and NMS typically includes rigidity and fever in patients on antipsychotics."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman with bipolar II disorder is started on lamotrigine for depressive episodes. After two weeks, she develops a widespread maculopapular rash involving her trunk and face. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management, and what is the most likely mechanism of this adverse effect?",
    "choices": [
      "Continue lamotrigine with antihistamines; delayed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity",
      "Switch to valproic acid; lamotrigine blocks GABA-A receptors causing rash",
      "Discontinue lamotrigine immediately; risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to rapid titration",
      "Add carbamazepine to mitigate rash; lamotrigine cross-reactivity is rare",
      "Switch to lithium; rash is due to serotonin excess from lamotrigine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Discontinue lamotrigine immediately; risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to rapid titration. Lamotrigine carries a known risk of severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), especially when titrated too quickly, combined with valproate, or in pediatric patients. The rash requires immediate discontinuation and rechallenge is contraindicated. The mechanism is not IgE-mediated but rather idiosyncratic, possibly involving T-cell activation. Adding carbamazepine is incorrect due to shared risk of rash. Lamotrigine does not cause serotonin excess."

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder has not responded to lithium monotherapy. She has a history of obesity, mild hepatic steatosis, and is planning pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacologic strategy for long-term mood stabilization?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate valproic acid for its superior antimanic efficacy",
      "Add carbamazepine for dual mood stabilization",
      "Switch to lamotrigine due to favorable metabolic and reproductive profile",
      "Switch to olanzapine for rapid symptom control",
      "Start quetiapine; titrate to â‰¥800 mg/day"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Switch to lamotrigine due to favorable metabolic and reproductive profile. Lamotrigine is preferred in women planning pregnancy due to its low teratogenic risk, favorable metabolic profile (weight neutral), and efficacy in bipolar depression and maintenance. Valproate and carbamazepine are contraindicated due to high teratogenic risk. Olanzapine and quetiapine have metabolic side effects and are not first-line for long-term monotherapy in this context. Quetiapineâ€™s use at high doses increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, which is particularly relevant in a patient with obesity and hepatic steatosis."

During the visit, she appears guarded and avoids eye contact. Which of the following approaches best reflects a trauma-informed care model that could improve patient engagement and reduce risk of retraumatization?",
    "choices": [
      "Confront the patient about noncompliance and emphasize adherence to treatment",
      "Use firm boundaries and standardized questioning to establish control and order",
      "Normalize the clinical setting by minimizing personal interaction and focusing on efficiency",
      "Acknowledge prior negative healthcare experiences and invite the patient to share concerns",
      "Remind the patient that medical care is objective and not influenced by past experiences"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Acknowledge prior negative healthcare experiences and invite the patient to share concerns. Trauma-informed care recognizes that many patients have experienced emotional, physical, or psychological trauma. Such experiences can result in distrust, avoidance, and difficulty engaging in care. Building trust through transparency, empathy, and acknowledging potential past harm improves engagement. Confronting or minimizing their concerns can lead to retraumatization or emotional withdrawal. Trauma-informed care prioritizes psychological safety and shared decision-making."

    "choices": [
      "Assigning patients to clinicians based on insurance status and availability",
      "Mandating uniform treatment protocols to minimize provider bias",
      "Allowing patients to choose examination timing and offering gowns or clothing coverage",

      "Emphasizing procedural competency in staff training over interpersonal communication"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Allowing patients to choose examination timing and offering gowns or clothing coverage. Trauma-informed care supports patient empowerment and autonomy through shared decision-making and meaningful choices. Offering patients agencyâ€”such as opting to remain clothed during exams or timing appointments around comfortâ€”directly supports these principles. The other options may increase efficiency but do not align with trauma-informed values, particularly the emphasis on individualized, collaborative, and respectful care."

    "question": "A 45-year-old male patient with chronic pain and a history of childhood abuse frequently misses follow-up appointments and becomes angry during visits when discussing medication changes. Which of the following best explains his behavior through the lens of trauma-informed care?",
    "choices": [
      "Personality disorder traits driving manipulative behavior",
      "Drug-seeking behavior due to opioid dependence",
      "Behavioral conditioning reinforced by past secondary gain",
      "Dysregulation of emotional and cognitive processes due to past trauma",
      "Somatization disorder manifesting as pain-focused resistance"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Dysregulation of emotional and cognitive processes due to past trauma. Trauma, particularly early and prolonged, affects the development of trust, emotion regulation, and the capacity to feel safe in clinical interactions. This patientâ€™s anger and resistance likely reflect a hypervigilant or defensive state rather than conscious manipulation. Trauma-informed care shifts the question from 'Whatâ€™s wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?', emphasizing understanding over blame and encouraging provider empathy."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man presents with a 9-month history of progressively worsening social withdrawal, flat affect, and episodes of believing that strangers are controlling his thoughts. He has no history of mood symptoms outside these psychotic episodes. He is admitted and started on haloperidol. Two days later, he develops severe muscle rigidity, high fever, confusion, and autonomic instability. Which of the following neurotransmitter actions is most directly implicated in the mechanism of both his psychotic symptoms and the treatment-related complication he developed?",
    "choices": [
      "Excess serotonin activity in the mesocortical tract",
      "Inhibition of norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus",
      "Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway",
      "Excess GABAergic tone in the tuberoinfundibular pathway",
      "Upregulation of NMDA receptor activity in the prefrontal cortex"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway. The patient's diagnosis is schizophrenia, based on his 9-month history of psychotic symptoms without mood episodes. He was treated with haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) with high D2 receptor antagonism, particularly in the nigrostriatal pathway, leading to extrapyramidal symptoms and potentially neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), as seen here. NMS is characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. The mesolimbic dopamine pathway is implicated in positive psychotic symptoms, while antipsychotic-induced D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal tract causes movement-related side effects. Other options involve incorrect neurotransmitters or pathways not primarily involved in this clinical picture."

    "choices": [
      "Dopamine blockade in the mesolimbic system",
      "Serotonin antagonism in the prefrontal cortex",
      "Increased prolactin due to tuberoinfundibular dopamine blockade",
      "Cholinergic antagonism in the hypothalamus",
      "Noradrenergic stimulation of anterior pituitary"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Increased prolactin due to tuberoinfundibular dopamine blockade. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) with relatively high D2 receptor antagonism compared to other SGAs. Dopamine normally inhibits prolactin release from the anterior pituitary via the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Blocking this pathway leads to elevated prolactin levels, resulting in galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and sexual dysfunction. This side effect is more pronounced with risperidone than other SGAs. The mesolimbic system is targeted to reduce positive symptoms, while the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive symptoms. Cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are not primarily involved in this side effect."

She returns to baseline after 4 weeks with no medication. Which of the following features most accurately distinguishes her diagnosis from schizophrenia?",
    "choices": [
      "Presence of hallucinations",
      "Presence of disorganized speech",
      "Absence of negative symptoms",
      "Duration of symptoms",
      "Precipitating psychosocial stressor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Duration of symptoms. The clinical scenario describes a brief psychotic disorder, which by DSM-5 criteria lasts between 1 day and less than 1 month, with full return to premorbid functioning. While hallucinations, disorganized speech, and psychosocial stressors can occur in both schizophrenia and brief psychotic disorder, the key distinguishing feature is the duration of symptoms. Schizophrenia requires continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months, including at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms. Negative symptoms may or may not be present in brief psychotic disorder and are not required for the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the ED by his parents due to bizarre behavior, including talking to himself and insisting that the government is inserting thoughts into his brain. His symptoms began 2 months ago, and he has shown social withdrawal, poor hygiene, and declining academic performance. He has no prior psychiatric or medical history. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnosis at this time?",
    "choices": [
      "Brief psychotic disorder",
      "Schizophreniform disorder",
      "Schizophrenia",
      "Schizoaffective disorder",
      "Delusional disorder"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Schizophreniform disorder. This diagnosis is made when the duration of psychotic symptoms is between 1 and 6 months. The patient displays hallmark psychotic features (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior, social withdrawal), but has not met the 6-month duration required for schizophrenia. Brief psychotic disorder lasts less than 1 month, while schizoaffective disorder includes a major mood episode concurrent with psychosis. Delusional disorder involves non-bizarre delusions and lacks prominent hallucinations or disorganized behavior."

    "question": "A 29-year-old man with schizophrenia is started on clozapine after multiple trials of other antipsychotics failed. After 3 weeks, he presents with fever, sore throat, and fatigue. Laboratory tests show an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 900/Î¼L. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Continue clozapine and monitor symptoms weekly",
      "Switch to risperidone immediately",
      "Discontinue clozapine and monitor for agranulocytosis",
      "Start G-CSF and resume clozapine at a lower dose",
      "Reduce dose and monitor ANC monthly"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Discontinue clozapine and monitor for agranulocytosis. Clozapine carries a serious risk of agranulocytosis, especially within the first 18 weeks. An ANC below 1,000/Î¼L warrants immediate discontinuation. Patients should be monitored closely and should not be rechallenged unless under specialist supervision. G-CSF is not routinely started unless severe neutropenia (<500/Î¼L). Switching to another antipsychotic such as risperidone is appropriate once neutrophil counts recover."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man presents with delusions of being surveilled by neighbors. He denies hallucinations or mood symptoms. He functions well at work but avoids social interactions. He has held the belief for over a year and is otherwise cognitively intact. Which of the following features best distinguishes his condition from schizophrenia?",
    "choices": [
      "Presence of delusions",
      "Absence of hallucinations",
      "Preserved functional capacity",
      "Lack of negative symptoms",
      "Duration of symptoms"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Preserved functional capacity. This patient has delusional disorder, characterized by the presence of one or more fixed, non-bizarre delusions lasting at least 1 month with otherwise preserved functioning and no marked impairment. Unlike schizophrenia, which involves functional deterioration, delusional disorder patients often maintain occupational and social capabilities. The duration and absence of hallucinations or disorganized thought are not sufficient to rule out schizophrenia alone."
