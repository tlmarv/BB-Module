    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents with complaints of frequent nighttime awakenings and unrefreshing sleep. He reports feeling tired despite being in bed for 8 hours. Polysomnography shows decreased slow-wave sleep and fragmented REM sleep. His physician considers prescribing a hypnotic that reduces sleep latency without significantly increasing total sleep time or disrupting sleep architecture. Which of the following agents is most appropriate for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Zolpidem",
      "Temazepam",
      "Flurazepam",
      "Ramelteon",
      "Diphenhydramine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Ramelteon. Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that specifically targets MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, promoting sleep initiation without significantly altering sleep architecture. It is especially useful in patients with difficulty falling asleep and has a favorable side effect profile. Unlike benzodiazepines and many non-BZ hypnotics (like zolpidem), it does not reduce REM or slow-wave sleep. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, has anticholinergic side effects and can impair cognitive function, especially in older adults."

    "question": "A 55-year-old woman undergoes a sleep study after long-standing excessive daytime sleepiness and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Her EEG during sleep shows alternating low-voltage fast activity with saw-tooth waves and muscle atonia, interspersed with periods of high-voltage delta activity. Which of the following best describes the physiological changes occurring during the sleep state associated with saw-tooth waves?",
    "choices": [
      "Decreased brain oxygen consumption and reduced sympathetic tone",
      "Suppressed skeletal muscle tone and increased phasic autonomic variability",
      "Stable heart and respiratory rate with maximal parasympathetic tone",
      "Enhanced baroreceptor sensitivity and increased muscle tone",
      "Preserved thermoregulation and homeothermic state"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Suppressed skeletal muscle tone and increased phasic autonomic variability. The saw-tooth waves are characteristic of REM sleep, during which skeletal muscle tone is nearly absent due to inhibitory brainstem mechanisms, and autonomic functions (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration) become irregular. REM sleep is paradoxically similar to wakefulness on EEG but physiologically distinct, with elevated brain oxygen consumption and loss of thermoregulation (poikilothermia). Parasympathetic dominance is present during NREM, not REM."

    "question": "A 19-year-old college student presents with difficulty maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, often sleeping late on weekends and struggling to fall asleep on Sunday nights. He is otherwise healthy. He is advised to improve his sleep hygiene. Which of the following recommendations would most directly address his sleep-wake cycle irregularity by reinforcing circadian rhythm entrainment?",
    "choices": [
      "Take a short nap after dinner daily",
      "Drink warm milk before bedtime",
      "Use electronic devices to relax before sleep",
      "Wake up at the same time every day including weekends",
      "Take melatonin in the morning to enhance arousal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Wake up at the same time every day including weekends. Irregular sleep-wake schedules, especially large differences in wake time between weekdays and weekends (social jet lag), disrupt the circadian rhythm. The suprachiasmatic nucleus governs circadian rhythm entrainment, and consistent wake time, particularly in the morning, helps anchor the internal clock. Napping late, screen exposure before bed, and melatonin in the morning all work against circadian alignment. Melatonin is more effective if taken in the early evening or before sleep onset in circadian rhythm disorders."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man presents with excessive daytime sleepiness and reports collapsing to the ground in response to laughter over the past year. He does not recall these episodes but says his girlfriend describes them as 'sudden losses of muscle control.' He also notes occasional hallucinations as he's falling asleep. PSG followed by MSLT reveals a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes and two sleep-onset REM periods. Which of the following neurotransmitter systems is most directly implicated in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Histamine-producing neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus",
      "Orexin-secreting neurons in the lateral hypothalamus",
      "Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain",
      "Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra",
      "Serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Orexin-secreting neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. This patient has classic features of type I narcolepsy—excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy triggered by strong emotions (e.g., laughter), hypnagogic hallucinations, and multiple sleep-onset REM periods on MSLT. The underlying pathology is loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons, which play a critical role in stabilizing wakefulness and REM transitions. Histamine neurons are involved in promoting wakefulness but not primarily implicated in narcolepsy. Cholinergic and serotonergic systems modulate sleep stages but are not causative in narcolepsy."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of Parkinson’s disease presents with a 7-year history of vigorous movements during sleep including punching, shouting, and falling out of bed. His wife notes these behaviors are often linked to vivid dreams. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate to initiate first in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Clonazepam at bedtime",
      "Pramipexole at bedtime",
      "Trazodone at bedtime",
      "Melatonin at bedtime",
      "Zolpidem at bedtime"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Melatonin at bedtime. The patient exhibits REM Behavior Disorder (RBD), characterized by loss of REM atonia and dream-enactment behaviors. RBD is common in Parkinson’s disease and may precede neurodegeneration. First-line treatment is melatonin due to its favorable safety profile, particularly in elderly patients. Clonazepam, while effective, is second-line due to risks of falls, confusion, and sedation. Trazodone and zolpidem may worsen symptoms or contribute to delirium. Dopamine agonists like pramipexole are not first-line for RBD."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is evaluated for difficulty falling asleep. He goes to bed at 10:30 PM but does not fall asleep until 1:00 AM. On weekends, he sleeps from 1:30 AM to 4:30 PM. He wakes up unrefreshed on school days but feels fine on weekends. Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) score is 28. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Administer melatonin at bedtime and restrict caffeine",
      "Initiate bright light therapy 1 hour before bedtime",
      "Schedule a polysomnography and MSLT",
      "Recommend chronotherapy with progressively delayed sleep times",
      "Start low-dose clonazepam to initiate sleep onset"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Recommend chronotherapy with progressively delayed sleep times. This patient meets criteria for Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD), a circadian rhythm sleep disorder common in adolescents. The MEQ score confirms an evening chronotype. Chronotherapy involves gradually delaying the sleep period to eventually align with a desired schedule. Bright light therapy should be used in the early morning to advance the circadian phase, not before bed. Melatonin is helpful if timed correctly—approximately 8 hours after habitual wake time—but is not first-line without sleep scheduling."

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents with complaints of sleep-maintenance insomnia. She falls asleep easily but wakes multiple times during the night. She has a history of depression and chronic kidney disease. Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for targeting her sleep disturbance with minimal risk of dependency or REM suppression?",
    "choices": [
      "Triazolam",
      "Zaleplon",
      "Trazodone",
      "Suvorexant",
      "Zolpidem"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Suvorexant. Suvorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) that inhibits wakefulness-promoting neuropeptides (OX1 and OX2). It is FDA-approved for sleep-maintenance insomnia and has minimal effect on sleep architecture. It is less sedating than benzodiazepines and has a lower abuse potential. Triazolam is short-acting and primarily used for sleep-onset insomnia. Zaleplon has an ultra-short half-life and is ineffective for sleep maintenance. Trazodone is used off-label and lacks strong evidence for sleep maintenance per AASM guidelines. Zolpidem can aid with sleep maintenance, especially the CR form, but has higher risk of complex sleep behaviors and residual sedation in older adults."

    "question": "A 47-year-old man with shift work disorder is prescribed a medication to improve circadian alignment. He reports no prior psychiatric or substance use history. Which of the following medications is most appropriate to initiate and what is its mechanism of action?",
    "choices": [
      "Zolpidem; GABA-A receptor alpha1 subunit agonist",
      "Ramelteon; MT1 melatonin receptor agonist",
      "Temazepam; GABA-B receptor agonist",
      "Lemborexant; 5-HT2 receptor antagonist",
      "Trazodone; D2 receptor partial agonist"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Ramelteon; MT1 melatonin receptor agonist. Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist selective for MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, useful in circadian rhythm disturbances such as shift work sleep disorder. It has no abuse potential, no rebound insomnia, and does not impair sleep architecture. Zolpidem acts on the GABA-A receptor, but does not address circadian misalignment. Temazepam is a benzodiazepine acting at GABA-A (not GABA-B) and alters sleep architecture. Lemborexant is a DORA, not a serotonin antagonist. Trazodone is a sedating antidepressant with complex pharmacology but is not first-line for circadian regulation."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man with chronic insomnia has been taking eszopiclone nightly for over 6 months. He reports no issues with tolerance or side effects and finds it helpful for both sleep onset and maintenance. Which of the following properties best explains why this medication is appropriate for chronic use?",
    "choices": [
      "It has a long half-life and suppresses REM sleep",
      "It acts on GABA-A receptors with high affinity for the beta-2 subunit",
      "It is a non-benzodiazepine with minimal disruption of sleep architecture and low abuse potential",
      "It is metabolized into active compounds that promote REM rebound",
      "It increases stage 2 NREM sleep and reduces slow-wave sleep"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: It is a non-benzodiazepine with minimal disruption of sleep architecture and low abuse potential. Eszopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist (nBBRA), or Z-drug, approved for chronic use in insomnia. It acts at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-A receptor, with selectivity for the alpha1 subunit, resulting in hypnotic effects without significantly altering REM or slow-wave sleep. Unlike benzodiazepines, it has a lower risk of tolerance and dependence. It does not produce REM rebound and is well tolerated for long-term therapy."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman with a BMI of 16.2 kg/m² presents with amenorrhea for 6 months, bradycardia, lanugo, and dry skin. She admits to excessive exercise and significant fear of weight gain despite her current appearance. Her labs show hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Which of the following findings would most likely be observed on bone mineral density testing?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased bone density due to increased cortisol",
      "Normal bone density due to young age",
      "Decreased bone density due to hypoestrogenism and malnutrition",
      "Increased bone density due to high levels of physical activity",
      "Osteosclerosis due to chronic metabolic alkalosis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Decreased bone density due to hypoestrogenism and malnutrition. Anorexia nervosa leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, resulting in low estrogen, which decreases bone mineralization. Malnutrition also reduces IGF-1 and calcium intake, worsening bone loss. Despite the young age, osteopenia and osteoporosis are common complications. Physical activity does not compensate for the effects of hormonal dysregulation and malnutrition. Osteosclerosis is not typically seen in anorexia nervosa."

    "question": "A 19-year-old college student is brought to the clinic by her roommate due to episodes of vomiting and secretive eating behavior. She is of normal weight and denies any problems, but admits to using laxatives 'occasionally.' Physical exam reveals calluses on the dorsal surface of her hand. Which of the following laboratory abnormalities is most consistent with this patient’s condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis",
      "Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis",
      "Hyponatremia and respiratory alkalosis",
      "Hypermagnesemia and increased anion gap",
      "Elevated creatine kinase and hyperphosphatemia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. This patient likely has bulimia nervosa, suggested by normal BMI, binge-purge behavior, and Russell’s sign (hand calluses from self-induced vomiting). Repeated vomiting leads to hydrogen and potassium loss, resulting in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Laxative abuse may also contribute to hypokalemia, but typically leads to metabolic acidosis. Elevated CK and hyperphosphatemia are more characteristic of refeeding syndrome or rhabdomyolysis."

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman with a longstanding history of anorexia nervosa is hospitalized for nutritional rehabilitation. On day 4 of refeeding, she becomes confused and tachycardic. Labs reveal hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Which of the following pathophysiologic mechanisms most directly explains her current clinical deterioration?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased protein catabolism and ammonia accumulation",
      "Sudden increase in cortisol leading to adrenal insufficiency",
      "Rapid insulin secretion shifting electrolytes intracellularly",
      "Enhanced PTH activity leading to renal phosphate loss",
      "Thiamine deficiency impairing glucose metabolism"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Rapid insulin secretion shifting electrolytes intracellularly. Refeeding syndrome occurs when a malnourished individual begins receiving nutrition again, causing a surge in insulin secretion. This drives glucose and electrolytes like phosphate, potassium, and magnesium into cells, resulting in severe hypophosphatemia and associated complications such as arrhythmia, delirium, and cardiac failure. Thiamine deficiency may contribute, but the most direct mechanism is insulin-mediated electrolyte shift. Cortisol and PTH are not the primary drivers."

    "question": "A 29-year-old man with opioid use disorder is brought to the emergency department by his roommate who found him unresponsive. Naloxone is administered with rapid improvement in mental status. The patient states he wants help and is willing to start treatment today. Which of the following medications should be initiated to minimize cravings while allowing outpatient initiation without precipitating withdrawal?",
    "choices": [
      "Methadone",
      "Naltrexone",
      "Naloxone",
      "Disulfiram",
      "Buprenorphine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms and can be safely initiated in the outpatient setting once mild to moderate withdrawal has begun, avoiding precipitated withdrawal. Methadone is a full opioid agonist but requires administration at certified opioid treatment programs and poses overdose risk. Naltrexone is a full opioid antagonist and would precipitate withdrawal if administered before complete detoxification. Disulfiram is used for alcohol dependence, not opioids. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used for acute overdose reversal, not long-term management."

Screening reveals she answered 'Yes' to the 'Alone' and 'Forget' questions on the CRAFFT questionnaire. Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Reassurance and no further intervention",
      "Referral to inpatient addiction treatment",
      "Administer the full CRAFFT questionnaire",
      "Start pharmacologic therapy for alcohol use disorder",
      "Initiate naltrexone therapy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Administer the full CRAFFT questionnaire. The CRAFFT is a two-part screening tool endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and NIDA for adolescents. If any Part A question is answered affirmatively (such as 'Alone' or 'Forget'), then the full six-question Part B should be administered. This allows further assessment and identification of risk. Pharmacotherapy or referral is premature without a full assessment. Naltrexone is not first-line in this setting."

    "question": "A 40-year-old man with chronic back pain has been prescribed long-term opioids. His provider is considering tapering due to concerns about dependency. Which of the following findings would most strongly suggest addiction rather than physical dependence?",
    "choices": [
      "Development of withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction",
      "Use of multiple providers to obtain opioids",
      "Persistent use despite appearance of withdrawal symptoms",
      "Tolerance requiring higher doses over time",
      "Dry mouth and constipation with medication use"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Use of multiple providers to obtain opioids. Addiction is characterized by compulsive drug use, impaired control, and continued use despite harm. 'Doctor shopping' reflects risky drug-seeking behavior and is a hallmark of addiction. Physical dependence refers to physiological adaptation (e.g., withdrawal, tolerance) and may occur even with appropriately prescribed medication. Withdrawal and tolerance alone do not equal addiction."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents for psychiatric evaluation after a series of failed interpersonal relationships. She describes alternating between intense admiration and sudden hatred toward her partners. She has a history of impulsive spending, recurrent self-harming behaviors, and reports feeling chronically empty. During the interview, she becomes tearful and accuses the clinician of not caring about her. Which of the following defense mechanisms is most characteristic of this patient's condition?",

      "Intellectualization",
      "Projection",
      "Splitting",
      "Reaction formation",
      "Sublimation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Splitting. This patient meets criteria for borderline personality disorder, as evidenced by her unstable relationships, affective instability, impulsivity, and identity disturbance. Splitting is a primitive defense mechanism in which individuals see others as all good or all bad, with no middle ground—common in BPD. Projection is more typical in paranoid PD. Reaction formation involves doing the opposite of an unacceptable impulse. Intellectualization and sublimation are more mature defenses and are not characteristic of BPD."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Paranoid personality disorder. The patient exhibits pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others, a hallmark of paranoid PD. Unlike schizotypal PD, he does not report magical thinking, odd beliefs, or perceptual distortions. Schizoid PD is marked by emotional detachment and lack of interest in social relationships, but without pervasive suspicion. Avoidant PD involves social inhibition due to fear of rejection, not paranoia. OCPD involves rigid perfectionism, not distrust."

He reports that he enjoys deceiving people to get what he wants. He was diagnosed with conduct disorder at age 15. Which of the following personality disorders is most closely related to his condition, and what is the minimum age required for diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Borderline personality disorder; 16 years old",
      "Narcissistic personality disorder; 18 years old",
      "Antisocial personality disorder; 18 years old",
      "Paranoid personality disorder; 21 years old",
      "Histrionic personality disorder; 18 years old"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Antisocial personality disorder; 18 years old. Antisocial personality disorder requires evidence of conduct disorder before age 15 and can only be diagnosed in individuals 18 years or older. It is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. Narcissistic PD involves grandiosity and need for admiration, but not the criminal behavior and deceit. Borderline PD involves emotional instability and impulsivity but not persistent violation of rights. The age criteria for paranoid and histrionic PD are not as strictly defined as for ASPD."

His roommate reports that the patient has a history of heroin use and was last seen using approximately 2 hours ago. On arrival, the patient is somnolent with pinpoint pupils and a respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute. He is given naloxone 2 mg IV with prompt improvement in mental status and respiratory rate. One hour later, he again becomes drowsy and bradypneic. Which of the following best explains this recurrence of symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Renal clearance of naloxone is prolonged in opioid users",
      "Naloxone is metabolized into an active metabolite that induces sedation",
      "The half-life of naloxone is shorter than the half-life of the opioid",
      "Naloxone precipitates opioid withdrawal, which causes sedation",
      "The patient is experiencing re-intoxication from delayed absorption"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: The half-life of naloxone is shorter than the half-life of the opioid. Naloxone has a short half-life (30–120 minutes), and when used to reverse long-acting opioids (such as methadone or high-dose heroin/fentanyl), symptoms of opioid intoxication can recur once naloxone is cleared. This is why repeated dosing or continuous infusion may be necessary. Renal clearance is not the limiting factor. Naloxone does not induce sedation nor does it have active metabolites. Delayed absorption is unlikely with intravenous heroin use."

      "Administer lorazepam 0.5 mg PO every 6 hours for 24 hours"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Administer a loading dose of diazepam and monitor closely. This patient has moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal (CIWA score ≥15), putting him at risk for seizures and delirium tremens. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment, and diazepam is commonly used for its long half-life. Haloperidol is not first-line due to pro-convulsant potential. Clonidine treats autonomic symptoms but not seizures. Lorazepam at 0.5 mg is insufficient for CIWA >15. Thiamine should be given, but glucose must come after to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy."

      "Phencyclidine",
      "LSD",
      "Alcohol"

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Phencyclidine. PCP intoxication is characterized by severe agitation, violent behavior, vertical or rotary nystagmus, diminished response to pain, and psychosis. It also leads to severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Methamphetamine and cocaine can cause agitation and hyperthermia but are more associated with sympathetic overdrive and lack the characteristic nystagmus or analgesia. LSD causes hallucinations but not violent behavior or nystagmus. Alcohol intoxication leads to CNS depression, not agitation and hyperthermia."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Cyproheptadine and supportive care. This patient meets Hunter Criteria for serotonin syndrome (spontaneous and inducible clonus, hyperthermia, agitation, and use of serotonergic agents). Cyproheptadine, an H1 antihistamine with 5-HT2A antagonist activity, is used as an antidote. Haloperidol and dantrolene are not appropriate here; the former may worsen symptoms, and the latter is used for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Nifedipine is used for hypertensive crisis, not serotonin toxicity. Flumazenil is used for benzodiazepine overdose and may precipitate seizures."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Discontinue haloperidol and administer dantrolene. This presentation is classic for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition often caused by dopamine antagonist use. Management includes immediate cessation of the offending agent, supportive care, and medications like dantrolene or dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine). Naloxone is for opioid toxicity, cyproheptadine is for serotonin syndrome, and sodium bicarbonate is for TCA overdose. Propranolol has no role here and may worsen hypotension."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Sodium bicarbonate infusion. This patient is exhibiting signs of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, which causes anticholinergic toxicity and cardiac conduction delays (QRS >100 ms). Sodium bicarbonate is used to narrow the QRS and stabilize cardiac membranes by increasing extracellular sodium and alkalinizing the serum. Naloxone treats opioid overdose. Activated charcoal can be used early (within 2 hours) but is insufficient alone. Lorazepam is used for seizures but does not address the cardiotoxicity. Physostigmine is contraindicated due to risk of asystole in TCA overdose."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman with a history of major depressive disorder reports ongoing low energy, anhedonia, and social withdrawal despite taking sertraline for the past 8 months. She prefers non-pharmacologic treatments and is motivated to engage in therapy. Her psychiatrist recommends a structured psychotherapy that includes activity scheduling and gradual re-engagement with pleasurable activities. Which of the following therapeutic mechanisms is being employed in this case?",
    "choices": [
      "Cognitive restructuring",
      "Behavioral activation",
      "Exposure and response prevention",
      "Psychoanalysis",
      "Mindfulness-based stress reduction"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Behavioral activation. Behavioral activation is a core component of CBT used to treat depression by encouraging re-engagement with valued activities to improve mood and counteract withdrawal and avoidance. It is particularly helpful in cases where patients have residual depressive symptoms or where cognitive distortions are secondary to inactivity. Cognitive restructuring focuses on thought patterns, not behavior. ERP is used for OCD. Psychoanalysis is a long-term, insight-oriented therapy and is not part of CBT. Mindfulness-based approaches are part of third-wave CBT but are not the focus in this case."

    "question": "A 19-year-old college student with bulimia nervosa is enrolled in cognitive behavioral therapy-enhanced (CBT-E). Her therapist emphasizes self-monitoring of food intake and emotions, identifies distorted beliefs such as 'My self-worth equals my weight,' and introduces behavioral experiments involving exposure to high-calorie foods. Which of the following best characterizes the structure and goal of CBT-E in the treatment of eating disorders?",
    "choices": [
      "Focuses solely on nutritional counseling and weight restoration",
      "Teaches patients to suppress intrusive thoughts about food and body image",
      "Addresses both cognitive distortions and behavioral avoidance patterns",
      "Reinforces strict control over caloric intake through journaling",
      "Utilizes aversive conditioning to reduce binge eating"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Addresses both cognitive distortions and behavioral avoidance patterns. CBT-E is an empirically supported, structured therapy that targets the maladaptive thoughts and behaviors associated with eating disorders. It includes psychoeducation, self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, exposure to feared foods, and body image interventions. It does not rely solely on weight restoration (A), thought suppression (B), reinforcement of restriction (D), or aversive conditioning (E), which are inconsistent with CBT principles."

    "question": "A randomized controlled trial compared Behavioral Activation (BA), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Transdiagnostic CBT (TD-CBT) for treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results showed that reduction in emotional symptomatology was greatest in the group with the highest increase in activation over time. Which of the following conclusions is most consistent with this finding?",
    "choices": [
      "Experiential avoidance is the primary therapeutic target of CBT",
      "Cognitive restructuring is superior to exposure-based techniques",
      "Activation is a key transdiagnostic mechanism underlying symptom improvement",
      "Behavioral techniques are only effective when paired with pharmacotherapy",
      "ACT has greater long-term efficacy than standard CBT"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Activation is a key transdiagnostic mechanism underlying symptom improvement. The trial results suggest that increasing activation (engagement in meaningful and goal-directed behaviors) leads to significant clinical improvement across multiple therapy types, making it a central mechanism in transdiagnostic approaches. Experiential avoidance (A) is more central to ACT, not CBT. There is no evidence here supporting superiority of cognitive over exposure techniques (B). CBT can be effective without medications (D), and the study did not show ACT had superior outcomes to standard CBT (E)."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man is diagnosed with colon cancer and is discussing treatment options with his oncologist. During the conversation, he appears emotionally detached and repeatedly redirects the discussion to specifics about chemotherapy cycles and survival statistics. He shows no outward emotion about the diagnosis. Which of the following defense mechanisms is he most likely using?",
    "choices": [
      "Suppression",
      "Intellectualization",
      "Repression",
      "Denial",
      "Displacement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Intellectualization. Intellectualization involves avoiding emotional distress by focusing on the intellectual or factual components of a situation. In this case, the patient is detaching from his emotional response to a cancer diagnosis by focusing only on clinical aspects. Suppression is a conscious decision to delay dealing with emotions, while repression is unconscious forgetting. Denial involves rejecting the reality of the diagnosis, and displacement would involve redirecting emotional distress onto another target."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman recently lost her job and has since begun yelling at her roommate over minor inconveniences and snapping at strangers in public. She denies being upset about her termination but shows signs of irritability and aggression. Which of the following defense mechanisms best explains her behavior?",
    "choices": [
      "Projection",
      "Acting out",
      "Displacement",
      "Reaction formation",
      "Sublimation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Displacement. Displacement involves redirecting emotional responses from the original source of distress (in this case, losing her job) toward a less threatening target (her roommate or strangers). Acting out involves impulsive behavior in place of verbalizing feelings but often lacks clear redirection. Projection would involve attributing her feelings to someone else. Reaction formation involves adopting the opposite stance to unacceptable feelings. Sublimation channels negative impulses into positive outlets, which is not occurring here."

    "question": "A 28-year-old medical student becomes involved in a nonprofit organization that mentors children of parents with substance use disorders. She discloses that her own father was an alcoholic who died of cirrhosis. She feels a deep sense of purpose in helping others with similar backgrounds. Which of the following defense mechanisms is most likely being demonstrated?",
    "choices": [
      "Sublimation",
      "Altruism",
      "Identification",
      "Displacement",
      "Intellectualization"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Altruism. Altruism is a mature defense mechanism where a person copes with distressing feelings by helping others in similar situations. In this case, the student is transforming her personal loss and pain into meaningful service. Sublimation involves redirecting unacceptable impulses (e.g., aggression) into constructive outlets. Identification involves adopting characteristics of others. Displacement and intellectualization are less applicable as her behavior is not redirecting or emotionally distancing from her feelings but embracing them in a prosocial manner."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man with a long history of opioid use disorder is initiated on a treatment that acts as a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. This agent is known to have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression and is available in sublingual and subcutaneous formulations. Which of the following properties of this medication most directly contributes to its ability to displace full opioid agonists from receptor sites?",
    "choices": [
      "Its full agonist activity at delta receptors",
      "Its irreversible binding to opioid receptors",
      "Its slow hepatic metabolism",
      "Its high receptor binding affinity",
      "Its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Its high receptor binding affinity. Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high affinity and slow dissociation, allowing it to displace full agonists such as heroin and prevent their euphoric and respiratory-depressant effects. This high receptor affinity underlies its utility in opioid substitution therapy. It does not irreversibly bind, and it does not have significant delta receptor agonism or NMDA antagonism, which are not its main therapeutic mechanisms."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman is seeking help to quit smoking. She is prescribed a medication that inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake and also acts as a non-competitive antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. She is later found to have a history of bulimia nervosa and a seizure disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Continue treatment with careful dose titration",
      "Switch to nicotine replacement therapy only",
      "Add varenicline to augment smoking cessation",
      "Switch to nortriptyline as a safer alternative",
      "Administer bupropion under EEG monitoring"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Switch to nicotine replacement therapy only. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or eating disorders (e.g., bulimia) due to its dose-dependent risk of lowering the seizure threshold. Nicotine replacement therapy would be a safer alternative. Augmenting with varenicline would be inappropriate without first stopping bupropion, and EEG monitoring is not a standard preventive measure in this context."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man with alcohol use disorder is initiated on a medication that reduces relapse and is associated with hepatotoxicity. He reports that his alcohol cravings are less intense and he feels less reward from drinking. Prior to initiation, he abstained from alcohol for 5 days. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of this medication?",
    "choices": [
      "Irreversible inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase",
      "Partial agonism at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors",
      "NMDA receptor antagonism and GABA modulation",
      "Full antagonism at the mu-opioid receptor",
      "Selective inhibition of D2 dopamine receptors"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Full antagonism at the mu-opioid receptor. Naltrexone is a full antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor and reduces the reinforcing effects of alcohol, thereby reducing cravings and the likelihood of relapse. It is associated with hepatotoxicity and must be used with caution in patients with liver disease. Disulfiram (A) inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Varenicline (B) is a partial nicotinic receptor agonist. Acamprosate (C) acts on NMDA and GABA, but it is not associated with hepatotoxicity. Dopamine D2 antagonism (E) is not a mechanism involved in alcohol MAT."
