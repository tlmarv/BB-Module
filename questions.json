  "question": "A 19-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department with progressive confusion, bizarre behavior, fever, and headache. MRI shows bilateral temporal lobe hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein, and normal glucose. PCR confirms HSV-1. If she survives, what long-term complication is most likely?",
  "choices": [
    "Flaccid paralysis from anterior horn cell damage",
    "Cerebellar ataxia from cerebellar inflammation",
    "Wernicke's aphasia from superior temporal gyrus injury",
    "Anterograde amnesia from medial temporal lobe injury",
    "Parkinsonian tremor from basal ganglia damage"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Anterograde amnesia from medial temporal lobe injury. HSV-1 encephalitis preferentially affects the temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, which is critical for memory formation. This can lead to profound anterograde amnesia in survivors. Flaccid paralysis is more typical of poliovirus or West Nile virus affecting the anterior horn. Cerebellar ataxia is associated with VZV, especially in children. Wernicke's aphasia arises from damage to the posterior superior temporal gyrus, not the medial temporal lobe. Parkinsonian features are more typical in West Nile virus encephalitis."

  "question": "A 70-year-old man with a recent shingles outbreak now presents with confusion, right facial droop, and a seizure. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. MRI shows left cerebellar hyperintensity. PCR for HSV is negative. What is the most appropriate management?",
  "choices": [
    "Initiate ceftriaxone and vancomycin for empiric bacterial meningitis",
    "Administer high-dose corticosteroids only",
    "Begin intravenous acyclovir and prednisone",
    "Repeat lumbar puncture and delay treatment until confirmatory testing",
    "Withhold antivirals due to negative HSV PCR"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Begin intravenous acyclovir and prednisone. This presentation is consistent with varicella zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis. Even if PCR is negative (only ~30% sensitive), treatment should not be delayed. The correct approach includes IV acyclovir and short-course corticosteroids. Bacterial meningitis should be ruled out, but the focal neurologic signs, prior shingles, and MRI findings point to VZV. High-dose corticosteroids alone are not adequate, and waiting for confirmatory tests would delay essential treatment."

{
  "question": "A 55-year-old man presents in late summer with fever, headache, tremor, and difficulty walking. Neurologic exam shows hyperreflexia and spasticity. MRI reveals hyperintensity in the thalamus and external capsule. CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and positive IgM for a flavivirus. What is the most likely causative agent?",
  "choices": [
    "HSV-1",
    "Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus",
    "West Nile virus",
    "La Crosse virus",
    "Rabies virus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: West Nile virus. It is the most common arboviral encephalitis in the U.S. Clinical signs such as tremor, cerebellar signs, parkinsonism, and spastic paralysis with corresponding thalamic and basal ganglia MRI findings are characteristic. HSV-1 typically affects the temporal lobes. EEE is more often severe in children. La Crosse virus affects children more and does not typically produce these parkinsonian signs. Rabies usually presents with hydrophobia, laryngeal spasm, and rapid deterioration."

  "question": "A 58-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presents with worsening headache, blurry vision, and confusion for 3 weeks. On exam, he is febrile and has cranial nerve VI palsy. Lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure, low glucose, high protein, and 220 WBCs (80% lymphocytes). India ink stain is negative. CSF culture is pending. What is the most sensitive next step in diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Cryptococcal antigen test",
    "Bacterial culture",
    "Fungal culture",
    "Acid-fast bacilli smear",
    "Repeat India ink stain"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Cryptococcal antigen test. Cryptococcal meningitis is common in immunocompromised hosts including diabetics. While India ink has ~50% sensitivity, and culture is ~90%, the cryptococcal antigen test has >90% sensitivity and specificity, making it the most reliable and rapid diagnostic tool. Bacterial culture is inappropriate in suspected fungal meningitis. Acid-fast smear is for tuberculosis. Fungal culture is slower and less sensitive than antigen testing."

  "question": "A 72-year-old woman presents with progressive headache, fever, confusion, and seizure. She has a history of chronic sinusitis. MRI shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe. CT with DWI confirms restricted diffusion. Stereotactic aspiration reveals purulent fluid. What is the most likely Gram stain finding from this specimen?",
  "choices": [
    "Septate hyphae",
    "Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora",
    "Acid-fast bacilli",
    "Gram-negative diplococci",
    "Gram-positive bacilli"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora. Brain abscesses caused by contiguous spread from sinus infections are typically polymicrobial, involving streptococci and anaerobes. Septate hyphae would suggest invasive fungal infections, more common in severely immunocompromised patients. Acid-fast bacilli indicate TB, which more commonly causes meningitis. Gram-negative diplococci and Gram-positive bacilli suggest meningococcal or Listeria meningitis, respectively."

{
  "question": "A 63-year-old man presents with severe back pain and lower extremity weakness. He has a fever and difficulty urinating. ESR and CRP are elevated. MRI shows an epidural fluid collection compressing the spinal cord at T10. What is the most likely causative organism, and what is the best next step in management?",
  "choices": [
    "Candida albicans; begin fluconazole",
    "Streptococcus pneumoniae; administer IV penicillin",
    "Pseudomonas aeruginosa; obtain serial blood cultures and wait",
    "Staphylococcus aureus; urgent surgical drainage and empiric antibiotics",
    "Escherichia coli; initiate ceftriaxone"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Staphylococcus aureus; urgent surgical drainage and empiric antibiotics. S. aureus is the most common cause of spinal epidural abscess and can lead to rapid neurologic deterioration. Immediate surgical decompression and empiric antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) are necessary. Other options like E. coli or Pseudomonas are less common unless thereâ€™s a urinary or hospital source. Candida is rare and associated with profound immunosuppression."

  "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with progressive nausea, vomiting, and gait instability. MRI reveals a midline cerebellar mass compressing the fourth ventricle and causing hydrocephalus. Pathology shows a hypercellular tumor composed of small round blue cells with frequent mitoses and Homer Wright rosettes. Which of the following molecular features is most likely associated with a poor prognosis in this tumor?",
  "choices": [
    "BRAF-KIAA fusion on chromosome 7q34",
    "Histone H3 K27M mutation",
    "MYC amplification",
    "NF2 gene mutation on chromosome 22q",
    "IDH1 mutation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: MYC amplification. This is associated with Group 3 medulloblastomas, which carry a poor prognosis. Medulloblastoma typically arises in the midline cerebellum and shows small round blue cells with Homer Wright rosettes. BRAF-KIAA fusion is seen in pilocytic astrocytoma. H3 K27M mutation is a marker for diffuse midline glioma. NF2 mutations are seen in ependymoma and schwannoma. IDH1 mutations are typical of adult gliomas, not pediatric tumors."
},
{
  "question": "A 9-year-old girl with Neurofibromatosis type 1 presents with seizures. MRI reveals a cortical mass in the temporal lobe. Biopsy shows a circumscribed tumor with large binucleate ganglion cells and scattered astrocytes. What molecular alteration most likely explains the pathogenesis of this tumor?",
  "choices": [
    "Activation of mTOR via TSC1 mutation",
    "BRAF fusion leading to MAPK activation",
    "p53 loss via germline mutation",
    "IDH1 R132H mutation",
    "Deletion of 1p/19q chromosomal arms"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: BRAF fusion leading to MAPK activation. Gangliogliomas are grade 1 neuronal tumors that often occur in the temporal lobe and present with seizures. They are frequently associated with BRAF mutations/fusions activating the MAPK pathway. TSC1 mutations are linked to tuberous sclerosis, not NF1. p53 loss is associated with high-grade tumors like medulloblastoma or glioblastoma. IDH1 mutations are typical in adult gliomas. 1p/19q co-deletion defines oligodendrogliomas, not gangliogliomas."
},
{
  "question": "A 4-year-old boy presents with headache, vomiting, and ataxia. MRI shows a posterior fossa mass extending into the fourth ventricle. Surgical pathology demonstrates a tumor with perivascular pseudorosettes and GFAP positivity. Which of the following factors would be most predictive of poor outcome in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Presence of eosinophilic granular bodies",
    "Biphasic histologic pattern",
    "Age less than 6 years",
    "Homer Wright rosettes on histology",
    "Loss of 1p/19q chromosomal regions"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Age less than 6 years. This presentation is classic for ependymoma, which commonly arises in the posterior fossa in children. Poor prognostic indicators include younger age, posterior fossa location, incomplete resection, and certain molecular subtypes like type A or ZFTA-fusion. Eosinophilic granular bodies and biphasic pattern are seen in pilocytic astrocytoma. Homer Wright rosettes are associated with medulloblastoma. 1p/19q co-deletion is a favorable marker for oligodendrogliomas."
},
{
  "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with new-onset seizures and right-sided weakness. MRI shows a ring-enhancing lesion crossing the corpus callosum. Surgical resection reveals pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Molecular studies are negative for IDH mutation and H3 K27M. Which additional finding best supports the diagnosis and has therapeutic implications?",
  "choices": [
    "ATRX gene loss on immunohistochemistry",
    "1p/19q codeletion",
    "MGMT promoter methylation",
    "BRAF V600E mutation",
    "Histone H3 K27M mutation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: MGMT promoter methylation. This patient has a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, which presents as a ring-enhancing, infiltrative lesion with histologic features like pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter methylation is a favorable prognostic biomarker that predicts better response to alkylating agents like temozolomide. ATRX loss and 1p/19q codeletion are features of lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas. BRAF mutation is more typical in pediatric or low-grade gliomas. H3 K27M mutation is associated with diffuse midline glioma, primarily in children."
},
{
  "question": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of low-grade oligodendroglioma presents with worsening headaches and visual changes. MRI shows an enlarging mass in the left frontal lobe. Biopsy shows mitotic figures and microvascular proliferation. What additional molecular finding confirms the diagnosis and guides therapy?",
  "choices": [
    "H3 K27M mutation",
    "BRAF-KIAA fusion",
    "IDH1 mutation with 1p/19q codeletion",
    "Loss of CDKN2A/B",
    "TERT promoter mutation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: IDH1 mutation with 1p/19q codeletion. These are defining molecular features of oligodendroglioma, required for diagnosis per WHO 2021 criteria. The presence of mitoses and microvascular proliferation indicates progression to a higher grade (grade 3). This tumor responds best to combined therapy (PCV + radiation). H3 K27M is linked to midline gliomas. BRAF-KIAA fusion is seen in pilocytic astrocytomas. CDKN2A/B loss is a poor prognostic feature in high-grade astrocytomas. TERT promoter mutations can be seen in glioblastoma but are not defining for oligodendroglioma."

{
  "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with a headache and a seizure. MRI reveals a well-circumscribed, dural-based mass with a dural tail sign. Histology shows meningothelial whorls and psammoma bodies. Which of the following findings, if present, would most strongly predict an aggressive clinical course and high recurrence risk?",
  "choices": [
    "Brain invasion on histology",
    "NF2 gene deletion",
    "Presence of psammoma bodies",
    "CD20 positivity on immunostaining",
    "Female sex"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Brain invasion on histology. Meningiomas are usually benign (grade I), but histologic evidence of brain invasion upgrades the tumor and is associated with increased recurrence risk and worse prognosis. NF2 deletion (22q) is common but not prognostic by itself. Psammoma bodies are common in grade I meningiomas and not indicative of aggressive behavior. CD20 positivity suggests lymphoma, not meningioma. Female sex is associated with increased incidence but not worse prognosis."

{
  "question": "A 58-year-old man presents with headaches and altered mental status. MRI shows a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right cerebral hemisphere with central necrosis and surrounding vasogenic edema. The lesion crosses the corpus callosum. Which histopathologic and molecular finding would most strongly correlate with this tumorâ€™s aggressive behavior and poor prognosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Presence of Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies",
    "Perivascular pseudorosettes and 1p/19q codeletion",
    "Pseudopalisading necrosis and IDH-wild type status",
    "Small round blue cells with Homer Wright rosettes and BRAF mutation",
    "Calcification and slow-growing cortical mass with CD34 positivity"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Pseudopalisading necrosis and IDH-wild type status. The imaging and clinical presentation are consistent with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), particularly given the butterfly pattern crossing the corpus callosum, central necrosis, and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. GBM is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and typically features pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. IDH-wild type status is associated with primary (de novo) GBM and portends a poorer prognosis. Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies are found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Perivascular pseudorosettes are characteristic of ependymomas. Small round blue cells with Homer Wright rosettes are seen in medulloblastoma. CD34 positivity with cortical calcifications suggests a slow-growing tumor like a ganglioglioma or DNET."

{
  "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with chronic seizures. MRI reveals a well-circumscribed, partially calcified lesion in the right temporal lobe. It is isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, with variable enhancement and cortical remodeling. Histology reveals mature neurons in a mixed glioneuronal stroma. Which genetic syndrome is most commonly associated with this tumor, and what other CNS lesion is characteristic of this syndrome?",
  "choices": [
    "Tuberous sclerosis; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma",
    "Neurofibromatosis type 2; bilateral vestibular schwannomas",
    "Neurofibromatosis type 1; optic pathway glioma",
    "Von Hippel-Lindau disease; cerebellar hemangioblastoma",
    "Li-Fraumeni syndrome; multifocal glioblastomas"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Tuberous sclerosis; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. The described lesion is consistent with a ganglioglioma, a benign mixed glioneuronal tumor often seen in the temporal lobe in young patients with epilepsy. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is commonly associated with cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA), typically arising near the foramen of Monro. NF2 is associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other intracranial tumors, while NF1 features optic pathway gliomas. VHL includes hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum and retina. Li-Fraumeni involves a variety of malignancies, including gliomas, but is not classically associated with ganglioglioma."

{
  "question": "A 47-year-old woman with headaches undergoes MRI which reveals a dural-based, homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass with a dural tail. The lesion is isointense to cortex on T1 and T2, and causes buckling of adjacent gray matter. Which of the following findings would most strongly support this diagnosis and has prognostic relevance?",
  "choices": [
    "S-100 protein positivity",
    "CD20 surface marker expression",
    "Loss of INI1 nuclear staining",
    "Progesterone receptor positivity",
    "EGFR amplification"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Progesterone receptor positivity. The imaging findings are characteristic of meningioma, an extra-axial tumor arising from arachnoid cap cells. These tumors are typically isointense to cortex on both T1 and T2, enhance vividly with gadolinium, and often display a 'dural tail' sign. Progesterone receptor positivity is common in meningiomas (seen in ~70%) and is associated with better prognosis and slower growth, especially in women. S-100 is seen in schwannomas, not meningiomas. CD20 is a B-cell marker relevant in CNS lymphomas. INI1 loss is associated with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. EGFR amplification is common in glioblastomas and implies a more aggressive behavior."

  "question": "A three-year-old boy is brought to the Emergency Department because of fever, headache, and a stiff neck for 24 hours. On exam, he is alert and oriented. He has a macular rash on his torso. His Kernig and Brudzinski signs are positive. His CSF shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, normal glucose, and negative bacterial cultures. The most likely cause of this syndrome is which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Enterovirus",
    "HSV-1",
    "LCM virus",
    "VZV",
    "West Nile virus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Enterovirus. Enteroviruses, especially echovirus and coxsackievirus, are the most common cause of viral (aseptic) meningitis in children. The classic CSF profile includes lymphocytic predominance, elevated protein, and normal glucose. A maculopapular rash and preserved mental status also favor a viral etiology. HSV-1 typically causes encephalitis with altered mental status and focal neurologic findings. HSV-2 is more associated with recurrent meningitis in adults. LCM virus is rare and often associated with rodent exposure. West Nile virus more commonly affects older adults and causes encephalitis."

{
  "question": "The most common arboviral encephalitis in the U.S. is which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Jamestown Canyon virus",
    "Powassan virus",
    "St. Louis Encephalitis virus",
    "Western Equine Encephalitis virus",
    "West Nile virus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: West Nile virus. West Nile virus is the most common cause of arboviral encephalitis in the U.S. It is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, often presents with fever and altered mental status, and can lead to flaccid paralysis or meningoencephalitis, particularly in the elderly. Other arboviruses listed here are much less common, although they may cause similar syndromes regionally."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man comes to a physician with low-grade fever, headache, and a stiff neck for three days. On physical exam, he is alert and oriented with nuchal rigidity and a positive Kernig and Brudzinski sign. CSF shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, a mildly elevated protein, normal glucose, and negative bacterial cultures. He has had an identical clinical syndrome on two previous occasions in the past four years. The most likely cause of his symptoms is which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Coxsackie A virus",
    "Echo virus",
    "HSV-1",
    "HSV-2",
    "VZV"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: HSV-2. HSV-2 is the most common cause of recurrent (benign) lymphocytic meningitis, also known as Mollaret meningitis. It typically presents with recurrent episodes of self-limited aseptic meningitis without long-term sequelae. CSF usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, and mildly elevated protein. HSV-1 is more commonly associated with encephalitis. Enteroviruses cause meningitis but are typically not recurrent in this age group."

  "question": "An 18-year-old college freshman is brought to the hospital because of fever, severe headache, and mental confusion. On exam, she is delirious and has a stiff neck. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 500 cells, 90% of which are neutrophils. CSF glucose is 10 mg/dL. The Gram stain is unhelpful. Which of the following organisms is most likely in her age group?",
  "choices": [
    "Haemophilus influenzae",
    "Listeria monocytogenes",
    "Neisseria meningitidis",
    "Streptococcus agalactiae",
    "Streptococcus pneumoniae"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Neisseria meningitidis. This is a classic case of acute bacterial meningitis in a young adult with neutrophilic CSF pleocytosis, low glucose, and elevated protein. Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adolescents and young adults, especially in group living environments such as college dormitories. The organism may not be seen on Gram stain due to prior antibiotics or technical limitations. It is a Gram-negative diplococcus, though other organisms can also present similarly depending on age and risk factors."

{
  "question": "A 60-year-old man is brought to the hospital with fever and altered mental status for 24 hours. He had received azithromycin earlier in the week for fever and myalgia. On exam he is febrile (103Â°F) and confused and has a stiff neck. Kernigâ€™s sign is present. A tentative diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is made. If this diagnosis is correct, which of the following CSF tests will be most affected by previous antibiotic therapy?",
  "choices": [
    "CSF bacterial antigen tests",
    "Culture",
    "Glucose",
    "Protein",
    "WBC count"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Culture. Antibiotic administration prior to lumbar puncture can rapidly sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to false-negative culture results. While protein and glucose levels, as well as white blood cell counts, may change more slowly and are less sensitive to early antibiotic therapy, bacterial cultures are significantly impacted. Antigen testing may still detect bacterial components even if the bacteria are dead, but culture requires live organisms."

CSF shows 850 WBCs, 90% of which are neutrophils. CSF protein is markedly elevated and glucose is low. On a probability basis, the Gram stain of the CSF will most likely show which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Gram-negative coccobacilli",
    "Gram-negative diplococci",
    "Gram-positive bacilli",
    "Gram-positive cocci in clusters",
    "Gram-positive diplococci"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Gram-positive diplococci. The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which appears as Gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococci on Gram stain. Neutrophilic CSF pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose are classic findings in bacterial meningitis. While other pathogens such as Listeria (Gram-positive rods) are also possible in this age group, the most likely organism by probability and presentation is S. pneumoniae."

{
  "question": "An 11-year-old boy developed acute meningitis 24 hours after scuba diving in a lake. A bacterial cause was excluded. Physicians caring for the boy should perform a wet mount of CSF looking for which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Acanthamoeba polyphaga",
    "Angiostrongylus cantonensis",
    "Ascaris lumbricoides",
    "Strongyloides stercoralis",
    "Trichinella spiralis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Acanthamoeba polyphaga. This organism is a free-living amoeba found in warm freshwater environments and is associated with granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. However, for acute meningoencephalitis following exposure to freshwater, especially with rapid onset after water activities like scuba diving, the most likely culprit is a free-living amoeba such as Acanthamoeba or Naegleria fowleri. These organisms invade the CNS through the cribriform plate. The other parasites listed typically cause subacute or chronic meningoencephalitis, eosinophilic meningitis, or systemic parasitic syndromes, not rapid-onset primary amoebic meningoencephalitis."

  "choices": [
    "Abdominal ultrasound",
    "Head CT scan",
    "Liver enzymes",
    "Lumbar puncture",
    "Urinalysis and urine culture"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Lumbar puncture. Neonates with fever and nonspecific signs such as poor feeding and lethargy require immediate evaluation for serious bacterial infections, including meningitis. Physical exam signs like Kernig's and Brudzinski's are often absent or unreliable in this age group. A lumbar puncture is essential to evaluate for central nervous system infection, as neonatal meningitis can progress rapidly. Abdominal ultrasound and liver enzymes might be considered in other contexts (e.g., if biliary atresia or hepatic dysfunction is suspected), but the priority here is ruling out meningitis."

    "Listeria monocytogenes",
    "Streptococcus agalactiae",
    "Streptococcus pneumoniae"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Streptococcus pneumoniae. Elderly patients are at high risk for pneumococcal meningitis, which presents with neutrophilic pleocytosis, very high protein, and low glucose in CSF. S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococcus and is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in older adults. E. coli and GBS are common in neonates, H. influenzae is more common in unvaccinated children, and Listeria is also seen in the elderly but less common than pneumococcus."

On exam her temperature is 39Â°C and her neck is stiff. Nystagmus is present on extraocular muscle testing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is slightly cloudy with a WBC count of 380/mmÂ³ (70% neutrophils and 30% mononuclear cells). Gramâ€™s stain of CSF shows rare, slender, Gram-positive bacilli. Which of the following is the likely source of this infection?",
  "choices": [
    "Contaminated food",
    "Contaminated water",
    "Pet cat",
    "Sick co-worker",
    "Sexual intercourse with her husband"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Contaminated food. The description is classic for Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular Gram-positive rod that causes meningitis, particularly in neonates, elderly, and immunocompromised individualsâ€”including pregnant women. It is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food such as soft cheeses, deli meats, and unpasteurized milk. It can cross the placental barrier and lead to fetal complications. Cats are associated with Toxoplasma, and the other options are not relevant for Listeria."

Assuming the Gramâ€™s stain of CSF is unhelpful, empiric treatment for which of the following organisms is appropriate?",
  "choices": [
    "Anaerobes",
    "Candida albicans",
    "Neisseria meningitidis",
    "Staphylococcus aureus",
    "Streptococcus pneumoniae"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Staphylococcus aureus. Post-neurosurgical meningitis or meningitis after head trauma is commonly caused by skin flora introduced during surgery or injury. S. aureus, including MRSA strains, is a common cause in these settings. Anaerobes are rare in CSF infections, Candida is unlikely without immunosuppression or long hospitalization, N. meningitidis is more typical in young healthy populations, and pneumococcus is common but not the most likely post-op."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is: 85% mononuclear cells. Tuberculous meningitis typically presents with subacute or chronic symptoms, including headache, fever, and cranial neuropathies. The hallmark CSF findings include lymphocytic (mononuclear) pleocytosis, elevated protein, decreased glucose, and increased opening pressure. Neutrophilic predominance (choice A) is more characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Eosinophils (choice C) are not typically associated with TB meningitis, and a WBC differential showing only 5% mononuclear cells (choice D) would be too low to be consistent with TB."

    "question": "A 47-year-old man with chronic frontal sinusitis develops a brain abscess in the right frontal lobe. A Gram stain of drainage from the abscess would most likely show which of the following?",
    "choices": [
      "Gram-negative coccobacilli",
      "Gram-negative rods",
      "Gram-positive diplococci",
      "Mixed microbial flora",
      "Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is: Mixed microbial flora. Brain abscesses resulting from contiguous spread, such as from sinusitis or otitis media, are often polymicrobial. These infections typically involve a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic organisms, including streptococci and anaerobes like Bacteroides. Gram-negative coccobacilli (A) or rods (B) might be seen in hematogenous spread from infections such as endocarditis or lung abscesses, not commonly sinusitis. Gram-positive diplococci (C) are associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, more commonly linked to meningitis or pneumonia. Septate hyphae (E) would suggest fungal etiology like Aspergillus, typically seen in immunocompromised hosts."

  "question": "A 22-year-old prize fighter with multiple nasal fractures notes drainage of some clear, watery fluid from his nose when he bends down. The fluid tests positive for glucose. If he develops meningitis it will most likely be caused by which of the following organisms?",
  "choices": [
    "Haemophilus influenzae",
    "Neisseria meningitidis",
    "Staphylococcus aureus",
    "Streptococcus pneumoniae",
    "Streptococcus pyogenes"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Streptococcus pneumoniae. The presence of glucose-positive clear nasal discharge after head trauma suggests a CSF leak, which predisposes to meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism associated with meningitis following CSF leakage, especially due to skull fractures. Other options like H. influenzae and N. meningitidis can cause meningitis but are less commonly linked to trauma-induced CSF leaks."

  "question": "A 64-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled hypertension presents with sudden-onset right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. Non-contrast CT head reveals a hyperdense lesion in the region of the left putamen. What is the most likely underlying pathological mechanism responsible for this patientâ€™s presentation?",
  "choices": [
    "Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm rupture",
    "Arterial lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate vessels",
    "Amyloid deposition in cortical vessels",
    "Embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery",
    "Rupture of an arteriovenous malformation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Arterial lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate vessels. This patient has a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, most commonly involving deep structures such as the putamen. Chronic hypertension causes lipohyalinosis, leading to vessel wall weakening and rupture. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms can also cause hemorrhage but are more associated with microaneurysms and are less commonly implicated directly in pathology. Amyloid angiopathy affects cortical vessels and is linked to Alzheimerâ€™s. Embolic strokes cause ischemia rather than hemorrhage, and AVMs are rare in this age group without prior symptoms."

  "question": "A 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with subacute onset of severe left thigh pain followed by weakness and atrophy in the proximal left lower extremity. On exam, he has decreased patellar reflexes on the left. There is no sensory loss in a dermatomal pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy",
    "Diabetic mononeuritis multiplex",
    "Diabetic amyotrophy",
    "Femoral nerve compression",
    "Cauda equina syndrome"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Diabetic amyotrophy. Also known as lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, this condition presents in older patients with type 2 diabetes and features asymmetric, proximal pain and weakness, often preceded by severe pain. It is typically monophasic and partially self-limiting. Polyneuropathy is symmetric and distal, while mononeuritis multiplex involves multiple isolated nerves. Femoral nerve compression does not cause the same progressive pattern or intense initial pain. Cauda equina syndrome presents with bowel/bladder involvement and saddle anesthesia, which are absent here."

  "question": "A 27-year-old obese woman presents with daily headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Ophthalmoscopic exam reveals bilateral papilledema. MRI of the brain is unremarkable. Lumbar puncture shows opening pressure of 32 cm Hâ‚‚O with normal composition. What is the most appropriate first-line pharmacologic treatment?",
  "choices": [
    "Topiramate",
    "Mannitol",
    "Acetazolamide",
    "Dexamethasone",
    "Furosemide"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Acetazolamide. This patient meets criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a condition most common in obese women of childbearing age. The first-line pharmacologic treatment is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces CSF production. Topiramate may be added as adjunct but is not the initial treatment. Mannitol is reserved for acute ICP crises, dexamethasone is used for edema in brain tumors, and furosemide is not a standard first-line agent in IIH."

  "question": "A 67-year-old woman presents with a two-month history of low mood, insomnia, decreased appetite, and low energy. She recently retired after a 42-year teaching career and lives alone. She reports drinking two shots of vodka nightly to fall asleep. Her past medical history includes well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Mental status exam shows impaired concentration but normal thought process. What feature of her presentation most strongly represents a perpetuating factor according to the biopsychosocial model?",
  "choices": [
    "Her alcohol use to aid sleep",
    "Recent retirement from long-term employment",
    "Family history of depression",
    "Feelings of loss of identity",
    "Inconsistent sleep patterns"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Inconsistent sleep patterns. In the biopsychosocial formulation, perpetuating factors are those that maintain the disorder once it has started. Inconsistent sleep patterns can prolong symptoms of depression and interfere with recovery. Alcohol use and retirement are precipitating factors that triggered the episode. Family history is a predisposing factor that increases susceptibility. Feelings of identity loss are psychological aspects, but more appropriately framed as precipitating or possibly predisposing depending on context."

  "question": "A 35-year-old man visits his PCP for an annual exam. He denies any symptoms but is found to have mild anhedonia and poor sleep during screening. The physician considers initiating treatment for depression. According to USPSTF recommendations and current practice patterns, what is the most accurate statement about depression management in this scenario?",
  "choices": [
    "Depression screening should only be done in patients with known psychiatric history",
    "A psychiatrist must initiate all antidepressant therapy",
    "Primary care physicians manage the majority of depression cases in the US",
    "Neuroimaging is required prior to diagnosing depression",
    "DSM-5 criteria must be confirmed via structured diagnostic interview"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Primary care physicians manage the majority of depression cases in the US. Over 60% of mental health care delivery, including 79% of antidepressant prescriptions, occurs in primary care settings. Depression screening is universally recommended for adults by the USPSTF. While psychiatrists play a critical role, the shortage of specialists and collaborative care models mean that primary care often initiates and manages treatment. DSM-5 is used for diagnosis, but structured interviews are not required, and imaging is not standard for diagnosing depression."

  "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with confusion, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Her temperature is 39.2Â°C and blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg. She recently started a new antidepressant and is also taking sumatriptan for migraines. On exam, inducible clonus is noted. Which finding would most reliably support a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome over neuroleptic malignant syndrome?",
  "choices": [
    "Elevated temperature and hypertension",
    "Recent medication change",
    "Rigidity on physical exam",
    "Hyperreflexia and clonus",
    "Confusion and altered mental status"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Hyperreflexia and clonus. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by neuromuscular hyperactivity including hyperreflexia and clonus, which help distinguish it from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), where rigidity and bradyreflexia are more common. Both conditions share signs like fever and altered mental status. Medication changes may be involved in both, but serotonergic toxicity uniquely causes these specific neuromuscular findings."

  "question": "A 76-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital following a hip fracture. On day three of her admission, she becomes disoriented, inattentive, and intermittently agitated. Vital signs are normal. Review of medications shows that she is taking oxybutynin, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine for sleep. Neurological exam reveals no focal deficits. What is the most likely explanation for her altered mental status?",
  "choices": [
    "Progression of undiagnosed dementia",
    "Postoperative stroke",
    "Adverse effects of anticholinergic medications",
    "Hospital-acquired infection",
    "Undiagnosed seizure disorder"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Adverse effects of anticholinergic medications. This patientâ€™s acute onset of fluctuating attention, disorientation, and agitation in a hospitalized setting is consistent with delirium. Oxybutynin, diphenhydramine, and ranitidine are all anticholinergic agents known to precipitate delirium, particularly in elderly patients. Dementia progresses slowly and does not cause fluctuating attention. Stroke would typically present with focal deficits. Infection should be considered but is less likely without vital sign changes. Seizures can cause altered mental status but would usually involve postictal features or abnormal movements."

  "question": "A 29-year-old man with no psychiatric history is hospitalized for a severe case of pneumonia. Over the course of several days, he becomes withdrawn, minimally responsive, and begins posturing in bed. On exam, he demonstrates waxy flexibility and mutism. Vitals are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next diagnostic step?",
  "choices": [
    "Begin empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics",
    "Initiate high-dose antipsychotics",
    "Perform a lumbar puncture",
    "Administer a lorazepam challenge",
    "Order an urgent MRI of the brain"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Administer a lorazepam challenge. The patient demonstrates signs of catatonia (waxy flexibility, mutism, posturing), likely in the context of a medical illness. A lorazepam challenge test (1â€“2 mg IV or IM) is both diagnostic and therapeutic in catatonia. A positive response supports the diagnosis. Antibiotics are unnecessary unless there's clear evidence of infection. High-dose antipsychotics can worsen catatonia. A lumbar puncture or MRI may be considered later to rule out other causes but are not the immediate next best step."

  "question": "A 71-year-old male in the ICU becomes acutely confused, with fluctuating levels of consciousness and visual hallucinations. Neurological exam is non-focal. Labs reveal mild hyponatremia and elevated BUN. MOCA score has declined significantly compared to admission. Which of the following most accurately distinguishes his current condition from a major neurocognitive disorder?",
  "choices": [
    "Gradual onset of symptoms",
    "Memory loss as primary symptom",
    "Irreversibility of cognitive decline",
    "Presence of visual hallucinations",
    "Impaired attention with fluctuating course"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Impaired attention with fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset, fluctuating level of consciousness, and inattention, often with hallucinations. In contrast, major neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer's have a gradual onset and steady progression without fluctuations. Visual hallucinations may be seen in both but do not differentiate the two. Delirium is often reversible with correction of underlying causes, whereas major neurocognitive disorders are typically chronic and irreversible."

  "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for concerns regarding his speech. He says fewer than 20 words and does not use any two-word phrases. His parents report that he understands simple commands and points to objects when named. He frequently uses gestures and maintains eye contact. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "Expressive language disorder",
    "Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder",
    "Receptive language disorder",
    "Late language emergence"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Late language emergence. The child meets criteria for late language emergence (less than 50 words and no two-word combinations between 24â€“34 months). His intact receptive language, appropriate use of gestures, and social engagement (e.g., eye contact, pointing) are reassuring and suggest a good prognosis. Autism would present with broader social communication deficits. Expressive language disorder implies more persistent dysfunction. Mixed disorders would include receptive issues, which are not present. Receptive language disorder typically results in significant comprehension deficits, not seen here."

  "question": "A 7-year-old boy with normal intelligence presents with difficulty in spelling and writing sentences, although he excels in math and science. He avoids writing assignments and becomes frustrated during homework. Teachers note poor handwriting, difficulty spacing letters, and grammatical errors. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Dyslexia",
    "Dysgraphia",
    "Dyscalculia",
    "Expressive language disorder",
    "Specific learning disorder in reading"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Dysgraphia. This child shows hallmark features of dysgraphiaâ€”trouble with handwriting, grammar, and spelling despite normal intelligence and good performance in other academic domains. Dyslexia primarily affects phonological processing and reading. Dyscalculia affects numerical concepts. Expressive language disorder would affect verbal output. Specific learning disorder in reading would not explain writing-based frustrations and fine motor difficulties."

  "question": "A 6-year-old girl is referred for an evaluation due to difficulties in reading. She struggles with decoding new words, often mispronounces them, and avoids reading aloud. Her oral language development and comprehension are appropriate for her age. What neuroanatomical region is most likely underactive in this child?",
  "choices": [
    "Left occipitotemporal region",
    "Right frontal lobe",
    "Cerebellar vermis",
    "Bilateral temporal poles",
    "Medial prefrontal cortex"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Left occipitotemporal region. Dyslexia is associated with underactivation in the left hemisphere's occipitotemporal region, which is critical for automatic, rapid word recognition. The right frontal lobe and medial prefrontal cortex are involved in executive functions. The cerebellar vermis is implicated in coordination. The bilateral temporal poles are more involved in semantic memory and social processing, not phonological decoding."

  "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought in due to concerns about social difficulties. He does not engage in pretend play, avoids eye contact, and has intense interest in ceiling fans. He is sensitive to loud sounds and insists on taking the same route home every day. Language development is appropriate. What combination of DSM-5-TR criteria is required to confirm the diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Deficits in social communication alone",
    "Restricted, repetitive behaviors alone",
    "Both social communication deficits and restricted behaviors, present only after age 5",
    "Deficits in social communication and at least two restricted, repetitive behaviors, present early in development",
    "Either social or behavioral symptoms, but not both"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Deficits in social communication and at least two restricted, repetitive behaviors, present early in development. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) requires all three deficits in social communication (criteria A) and at least two of four restricted behaviors (criteria B), with onset in early development. The boy meets these with social avoidance and inflexible routines. Language may be intact. Criteria must be met across domains; one alone is insufficient."

  "question": "A 6-year-old girl is undergoing evaluation for poor academic performance. Her IQ is within the normal range, but standardized assessments reveal significantly low performance in reading, writing, and math. Vision and hearing are normal. Which of the following most accurately reflects the current DSM-5 diagnostic approach to specific learning disorder (SLD)?",
  "choices": [
    "Presence of low IQ is necessary for diagnosis",
    "Requires a significant IQ-achievement discrepancy",
    "Diagnosis is based solely on clinical judgment",
    "Standardized testing must confirm impairments relative to age expectations",
    "Requires poor school performance in all subjects"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Standardized testing must confirm impairments relative to age expectations. DSM-5 criteria for SLD require underachievement in specific academic domains despite adequate educational opportunities, confirmed by standardized testing. It no longer relies on a strict IQ-achievement discrepancy. Poor performance in one domain (e.g., reading, math) is sufficient. Clinical judgment complements, but does not replace, formal assessment."

  "question": "A 4-year-old boy with delayed milestones and below-average performance in daily self-care and social tasks is being evaluated. Cognitive testing reveals an IQ of 65, and adaptive behavior assessments show significant limitations in conceptual and social domains. Which of the following is the most accurate diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "Specific Learning Disorder",
    "Receptive language disorder",
    "Intellectual Developmental Disorder",
    "Expressive language disorder"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Intellectual Developmental Disorder. IDD requires deficits in both intellectual functioning (IQ < 70) and adaptive functioning across conceptual, social, or practical domains. This child has global impairment in daily life and subaverage intellectual performance. ASD focuses on social communication and behaviors. Learning disorders are academic-specific. Language disorders do not fully account for adaptive deficits."

  "question": "A 23-year-old woman with panic disorder is undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). She is encouraged to visit the grocery store, where she previously experienced panic attacks. Initially, she reports anxiety, but over several sessions, the anxiety diminishes. Which psychological mechanism best explains this improvement?",
  "choices": [
    "Operant extinction",
    "Habituation",
    "Stimulus generalization",
    "Classical extinction",
    "Negative reinforcement"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Classical extinction. The patient is exposed to a conditioned stimulus (e.g., grocery store) previously associated with an unconditioned response (panic attacks) without the panic-inducing event occurring. Over time, the conditioned response (anxiety) diminishes. This is the essence of classical extinction. Operant extinction involves cessation of reinforcement. Habituation is a decrease in response to repeated neutral stimuli, not conditioned ones. Stimulus generalization refers to transfer of a response to similar stimuli. Negative reinforcement involves removing an aversive stimulus to increase behavior, which is not applicable here."

  "question": "A 52-year-old man with opioid use disorder participates in a contingency management program. He receives a movie ticket for each negative drug test. Over time, he consistently remains abstinent. Which principle of behaviorism is most directly being applied to promote abstinence in this scenario?",
  "choices": [
    "Positive reinforcement via variable interval schedule",
    "Negative reinforcement via fixed ratio schedule",
    "Positive reinforcement via fixed ratio schedule",
    "Negative punishment via variable ratio schedule",
    "Classical conditioning of abstinence behavior"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Positive reinforcement via fixed ratio schedule. Contingency management provides tangible rewards (e.g., movie tickets) contingent on a target behavior (drug abstinence), which is a classic example of positive reinforcement. Since the reward is delivered after every drug-free urine sample, it is a fixed ratio schedule. Variable interval or ratio schedules involve unpredictability. Negative reinforcement involves removal of aversive stimuli, not reward delivery. Classical conditioning does not directly explain operant contingencies in this setting."

  "question": "A medical student observes a respected physician spend extra time with a patient and receive appreciation. The student later mimics this behavior during rounds. According to Banduraâ€™s social learning theory, which factor most directly facilitated this change in behavior?",
  "choices": [
    "Operant reinforcement of the student",
    "Classical conditioning of the student",
    "Stimulus generalization",
    "Observational learning and increased self-efficacy",
    "Shaping through successive approximations"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Observational learning and increased self-efficacy. Bandura's social learning theory emphasizes that people learn behaviors through observing others, especially role models. The physicianâ€™s behavior modeled a valued trait, and the student adopted it. Furthermore, the observation likely enhanced the studentâ€™s belief in their own ability to perform similar actions (self-efficacy). Operant reinforcement requires direct reward to the student, not just observation. Classical conditioning involves stimulus-response pairings. Stimulus generalization and shaping are more applicable in different contexts."

  "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents with episodes of unresponsiveness and convulsions. A recent inpatient video EEG monitoring revealed no epileptiform activity during these events. Neurological examination is normal. She has a history of fibromyalgia, past trauma, and depression. Which of the following factors most likely serves as a perpetuating factor for her condition, according to the Fear-Avoidance Learning Model?",
  "choices": [
    "History of childhood neglect",
    "Traumatic brain injury at age 17",
    "Current use of sedatives and repeated medical testing",
    "Recent panic attack preceding seizure onset",
    "Family history of epilepsy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Current use of sedatives and repeated medical testing. According to the Fear-Avoidance Learning Model, perpetuating factors are those that maintain symptoms over time, such as overmedicalization, lack of appropriate diagnosis, avoidance behaviors, and use of medications like sedatives. Childhood neglect and brain injury are predisposing factors; panic attack is a precipitating factor; and family history contributes to overall risk but does not perpetuate symptoms directly."

  "question": "A 33-year-old man is diagnosed with functional neurological disorder (FND) after video EEG confirms psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. His neurologist explains the diagnosis, demonstrates positive signs, and offers a CBT-based treatment plan. This form of clinical engagement serves which therapeutic purpose in the management of FND?",
  "choices": [
    "Avoidance of psychiatric labeling to prevent non-compliance",
    "Initiation of neurostimulation as primary treatment",
    "Application of diagnosis as a therapeutic intervention",
    "Replacement of psychiatric referral with pharmacotherapy",
    "Reduction of symptoms by minimizing patient-provider interaction"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Application of diagnosis as a therapeutic intervention. Delivering the diagnosis of FND in a clear, empathetic manner, explaining the pathophysiology and demonstrating positive clinical signs, is itself a key intervention. It helps validate the patient's experience, build therapeutic alliance, and initiate recovery. Avoiding diagnosis or referrals undermines effective management. Pharmacotherapy targets comorbidities but is not a substitute for informed diagnosis and interdisciplinary care."

  "question": "A 29-year-old woman with PNES is referred for interdisciplinary treatment including CBT, physical therapy, and mindfulness training. She struggles with believing the diagnosis and shows low engagement. Which factor, if addressed during assessment, would most directly enhance her prognosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Severity of prior epileptic seizures",
    "Presence of comorbid sensory symptoms",
    "Motivation for recovery and treatment engagement",
    "Exact nature of the dissociative episodes",
    "Type of psychotherapy previously attempted"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The correct answer is: Motivation for recovery and treatment engagement. Prognosis in FND significantly improves when patients are motivated and engaged in treatment. A strong alliance with providers, belief in the diagnosis, and willingness to participate in therapy (especially CBT) are linked to better outcomes. The type of prior therapy and episode features are informative but less predictive than motivational factors. Comorbid sensory symptoms may contribute to burden but do not directly determine prognosis."
